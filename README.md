# google-cloud-sdk
Mirror of gcloud Google Cloud Platform SDK to track release changes

### What is this?
Every release, this repo picks up the `gcloud` Linux SDK and adds the sources to this repository using the [sync_gcloud_releases.sh](.github/workflows/sync_gcloud_releases.sh) script. The repo serves as a historical record of when code changes occurred to the SDK.

New releases are added within a day of general availability.
