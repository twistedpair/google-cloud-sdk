  Enums:
    InterfaceValueValuesEnum: Specifies the disk interface to use for
      attaching this disk, either SCSI or NVME. The default is SCSI. For
      performance characteristics of SCSI over NVMe, see Local SSD
      performance.
    ModeValueValuesEnum: The mode in which to attach this disk, either
      READ_WRITE or READ_ONLY. If not specified, the default is to attach the
      disk in READ_WRITE mode.
    TypeValueValuesEnum: Specifies the type of the disk, either SCRATCH or
      PERSISTENT. If not specified, the default is PERSISTENT.

  Fields:
    autoDelete: Specifies whether the disk will be auto-deleted when the
      instance is deleted (but not when the disk is detached from the
      instance).
    boot: Indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machine will use the
      first partition of the disk for its root filesystem.
    deviceName: Specifies a unique device name of your choice that is
      reflected into the /dev/disk/by-id/google-* tree of a Linux operating
      system running within the instance. This name can be used to reference
      the device for mounting, resizing, and so on, from within the instance.
      If not specified, the server chooses a default device name to apply to
      this disk, in the form persistent-disks-x, where x is a number assigned
      by Google Compute Engine. This field is only applicable for persistent
      disks.
    diskEncryptionKey: Encrypts or decrypts a disk using a customer-supplied
      encryption key.  If you are creating a new disk, this field encrypts the
      disk using a customer-supplied encryption key. If you are attaching an
      existing disk that is already encrypted, this field decrypts the disk
      using the customer-supplied encryption key.  If you encrypt a new disk
      using a customer-supplied encryption key, you must provide the same key
      again when attempting to use this resource at a later time (e.g. to
      create a snapshot or image from the disk or to attach the disk to a
      virtual machine).  If no customer-supplied encryption key is provided at
      creation, then the disk will be encrypted using an automatically
      generated key and you do not need to provide a key to use the disk
      later.
    index: Assigns a zero-based index to this disk, where 0 is reserved for
      the boot disk. For example, if you have many disks attached to an
      instance, each disk would have a unique index number. If not specified,
      the server will choose an appropriate value.
    initializeParams: [Input Only] Specifies the parameters for a new disk
      that will be created alongside the new instance. Use initialization
      parameters to create boot disks or local SSDs attached to the new
      instance.  This property is mutually exclusive with the source property;
      you can only define one or the other, but not both.
    interface: Specifies the disk interface to use for attaching this disk,
      either SCSI or NVME. The default is SCSI. For performance
      characteristics of SCSI over NVMe, see Local SSD performance.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#attachedDisk for
      attached disks.
    licenses: [Output Only] Any valid publicly visible licenses.
    mode: The mode in which to attach this disk, either READ_WRITE or
      READ_ONLY. If not specified, the default is to attach the disk in
      READ_WRITE mode.
    source: Specifies a valid partial or full URL to an existing Persistent
      Disk resource. This field is only applicable for persistent disks.
    type: Specifies the type of the disk, either SCRATCH or PERSISTENT. If not
      specified, the default is PERSISTENT.

      private (custom) image, and Compute Engine will use the corresponding
      image from your project. For example:  global/images/my-private-image

      example, to use a Debian image from the debian-cloud project, make sure
      to include the project in the URL:  projects/debian-
      cloud/global/images/debian-7-wheezy-vYYYYMMDD   where vYYYYMMDD is the
      image version. The fully-qualified URL will also work in both cases.

    description: An optional textual description of the resource; provided by

    diskEncryptionKey: Encrypts the disk using a customer-supplied encryption
      key.  If you encrypt the disk using a customer-supplied encryption key,
      and you want to use the disk later (e.g. to create a disk snapshot or an
      image, or to attach the disk to a virtual machine), you must provide the

    lastAttachTimestamp: [Output Only] Last attach timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    lastDetachTimestamp: [Output Only] Last detach timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    licenses: Any applicable publicly visible licenses.
    name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    options: Internal use only.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined fully-qualified URL for this
      resource.
    sizeGb: Size of the persistent disk, specified in GB. You can specify this
      field when creating a persistent disk using the sourceImage or
      sourceSnapshot parameter, or specify it alone to create an empty
      persistent disk.  If you specify this field along with sourceImage or
      sourceSnapshot, the value of sizeGb must not be less than the size of
      the sourceImage or the size of the snapshot.
    sourceImage: The source image used to create this disk. If the source
      image is deleted from the system, this field will not be set, even if an
      image with the same name has been re-created.  When creating a disk, you
      can provide a private (custom) image using the following input, and
      Compute Engine will use the corresponding image from your project. For
      example:  global/images/my-private-image   Or you can provide an image
      from a publicly-available project. For example, to use a Debian image
      from the debian-cloud project, make sure to include the project in the
      URL:  projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-7-wheezy-vYYYYMMDD
      where vYYYYMMDD is the image version. The fully-qualified URL will also
      work in both cases.
    sourceImageEncryptionKey: The customer-supplied encryption key of the
      source image. This key is required if the source image is protected by a
      customer-supplied encryption key.  If the incorrect key is provided, the
      operation will fail.
    sourceImageId: The ID value of the image used to create this disk. This
      value identifies the exact image that was used to create this persistent
      disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from an image that
      was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source image ID
      would identify the exact version of the image that was used.
    sourceSnapshot: The source snapshot used to create this disk. You can
      provide this as a partial or full URL to the resource. For example, the
      following are valid values:   - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/pr
      ojects/project/global/snapshots/snapshot  -
      projects/project/global/snapshots/snapshot  - global/snapshots/snapshot
    sourceSnapshotEncryptionKey: The customer-supplied encryption key of the
      source snapshot. This key is required if the source snapshot is
      protected by a customer-supplied encryption key.  If the incorrect key
      is provided, the operation will fail.
    sourceSnapshotId: [Output Only] The unique ID of the snapshot used to
      create this disk. This value identifies the exact snapshot that was used
      to create this persistent disk. For example, if you created the
      persistent disk from a snapshot that was later deleted and recreated
      under the same name, the source snapshot ID would identify the exact
      version of the snapshot that was used.
