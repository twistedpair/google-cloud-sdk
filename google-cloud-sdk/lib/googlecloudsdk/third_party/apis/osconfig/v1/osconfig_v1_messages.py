      patch steps, or if it fails to respond with a success notification
      before timing out. VMs that are not running or do not have an active

      rollouts, if the disruption budget in a zone is exceeded, the patch job
      stops, because continuing to the next zone requires completion of the
      patch process in the previous zone. For example, if the disruption
      budget has a fixed value of `10`, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the current

      completed. When that zone is completed successfully, patching begins
