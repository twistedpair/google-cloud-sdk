  Fields:
    filter: Sets a filter expression for filtering listed resources, in the

      field_name comparison_string literal_string.  The field_name is the name
      of the field you want to compare. Only atomic field types are supported
      (string, number, boolean). The comparison_string must be either eq
      (equals) or ne (not equals). The literal_string is the string value to
      filter to. The literal value must be valid for the type of field you are
      filtering by (string, number, boolean). For string fields, the literal
      value is interpreted as a regular expression using RE2 syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field.  For example, to filter for
      instances that do not have a name of example-instance, you would use
      filter=name ne example-instance.  You can filter on nested fields. For
      example, you could filter on instances that have set the
      scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. Use filtering on nested
      fields to take advantage of labels to organize and search for results
      based on label values.  To filter on multiple expressions, provide each
      separate expression within parentheses. For example,
      (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple
      expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must

    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than maxResults,
      Compute Engine returns a nextPageToken that can be used to get the next

      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name.  You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using orderBy="creationTimestamp desc". This sorts results based on the
      creationTimestamp field in reverse chronological order (newest result
      first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest
      operation is returned first.  Currently, only sorting by name or
