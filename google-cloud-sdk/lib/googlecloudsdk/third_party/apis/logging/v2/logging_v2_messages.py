      duplicates which can be removed. If omitted in new log entries, then
      Stackdriver Logging will insert its own unique identifier. The insert_id

      entries whose time stamps are more than a couple of hours in the future.
      Log entries with time stamps in the past are accepted.

      If both a start time and an end time are provided, then the end time
      must be later than the start time.
    filter: Optional. An advanced logs filter. The only exported log entries
      are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the
      filter. The filter must use the log entry format specified by the
      output_version_format parameter. For example, in the v2 format:

      accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for

      Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's
