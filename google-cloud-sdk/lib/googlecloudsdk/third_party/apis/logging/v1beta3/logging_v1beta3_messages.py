  different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
  used by gRPC (https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
  Simple to use and understand for most users Flexible enough to meet
  unexpected needsOverviewThe Status message contains three pieces of data:
  error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be an
  enum value of google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if
  needed. The error message should be a developer-facing English message that
  helps developers understand and resolve the error. If a localized user-
  facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error
  details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain
  arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error
  detail types in the package google.rpc that can be used for common error
  conditions.Language mappingThe Status message is the logical representation
  of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire format. When
  the Status message is exposed in different client libraries and different
  wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it will likely be
  mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to some error
  codes in C.Other usesThe error model and the Status message can be used in a
  variety of environments, either with or without APIs, to provide a
  consistent developer experience across different environments.Example uses
  of this error model include: Partial errors. If a service needs to return
  partial errors to the client, it may embed the Status in the normal response
  to indicate the partial errors. Workflow errors. A typical workflow has
  multiple steps. Each step may have a Status message for error reporting.
  Batch operations. If a client uses batch request and batch response, the
  Status message should be used directly inside batch response, one for each
  error sub-response. Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds
  asynchronous operation results in its response, the status of those
  operations should be represented directly using the Status message. Logging.
  If some API errors are stored in logs, the message Status could be used
  directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
