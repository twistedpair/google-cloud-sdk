    citc_snapshotVersion: The snapshot within the workspace. If zero, refers
      to the moving head of the workspace.  Clients which use zero should be
      robust against remote changes made to a workspace.  If non-zero, refers

    gerrit_gerritProject: The full project name within the host. Projects may
      be nested, so "project/subproject" is a valid project name. The "repo
      name" is hostURI/project.
    gerrit_hostUri: The URI of a running Gerrit instance.
    gerrit_revisionId: A revision (commit) ID.
    git_revisionId: Git commit hash. required.

    pageToken: The value of next_page_token from the previous call. Omit for
      the first page, or if using start_index.
    path: Path to the file or directory from the root directory of the source
      context. It must not have leading or trailing slashes.
    piper_branchName: Specifies that the source context refers to a branch,
      rather than the depot root.  For example, if the branch files live under
      //depot/branches/mybranch/25, then branch_name should be "mybranch/25".
    piper_changeNumber: CL number. If zero, represents depot head.
    piper_disableComponents: If false, use the released components as of the
      CL. If true, use true head.
    piper_versionMap: The complete components state description. If present,
      disable_components is ignored.  Not all services accept arbitrary
      version map.  Services not supporting arbitrary version maps must emit
      an error if this field is set, instead of silently falling back on
      disable_components.  This is a serialized VersionMap from
      //devtools/components/proto/version_map.proto. We use bytes instead of
      the actual type to avoid having a file under //google depend on one
      outside of //google.
    projectId: The ID of the project.
    repoName: The name of the repo. Leave empty for the default repo.
    snapshotId: The ID of the snapshot. An empty snapshot_id refers to the
      most recent snapshot.
    startPosition: If path refers to a file, the position of the first byte of
      its contents to return. If path refers to a directory, the position of
      the first entry in the listing. If page_token is specified, this field
      is ignored.

class Status(_messages.Message):
  """The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
  different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
  used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
  - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet
  unexpected needs  # Overview  The `Status` message contains three pieces of
  data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be
  an enum value of google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes
  if needed.  The error message should be a developer-facing English message
  that helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized
  user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error
  details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain
  arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error
  detail types in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error
  conditions.  # Language mapping  The `Status` message is the logical
  representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire
  format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different client libraries
  and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it
  will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to
  some error codes in C.  # Other uses  The error model and the `Status`
  message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without
  APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different
  environments.  Example uses of this error model include:  - Partial errors.
  If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,     it may embed
  the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial     errors.  -
  Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
  have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose.  - Batch operations. If
  a client uses batch request and batch response, the     `Status` message
  should be used directly inside batch response, one for     each error sub-
  response.  - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous
  operation     results in its response, the status of those operations should
  be     represented directly using the `Status` message.  - Logging. If some
  API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could     be used
  directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
