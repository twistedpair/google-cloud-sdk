class Status(_messages.Message):
  """The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
  different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
  used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
  - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet
  unexpected needs  # Overview  The `Status` message contains three pieces of
  data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be
  an enum value of google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes
  if needed.  The error message should be a developer-facing English message
  that helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized
  user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error
  details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain
  arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error
  detail types in the package `google.rpc` which can be used for common error
  conditions.  # Language mapping  The `Status` message is the logical
  representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire
  format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different client libraries
  and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it
  will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to
  some error codes in C.  # Other uses  The error model and the `Status`
  message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without
  APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different
  environments.  Example uses of this error model include:  - Partial errors.
  If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,     it may embed
  the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial     errors.  -
  Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
  have a `Status` message for error reporting purpose.  - Batch operations. If
  a client uses batch request and batch response, the     `Status` message
  should be used directly inside batch response, one for     each error sub-
  response.  - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous
  operation     results in its response, the status of those operations should
  be     represented directly using the `Status` message.  - Logging. If some
  API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could     be used
  directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

    InboundServicesValueListEntryValuesEnum:
    ServingStatusValueValuesEnum: The current serving status of this version.
      Only `SERVING` versions will have instances created or billed for.  If
      this field is unset when a version is created, `SERVING` status will be
      assumed. It is an error to explicitly set this field to
      `SERVING_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED`.

  Messages:
    BetaSettingsValue: Beta settings supplied to the application via metadata.
    EnvVariablesValue: Environment variables made available to the
      application. Only returned in `GET` requests if `view=FULL` is set. May
      only be set on create requests; once created, is immutable.

  Fields:
    apiConfig: Serving configuration for Google Cloud Endpoints. Only returned
      in `GET` requests if `view=FULL` is set. May only be set on create
      requests; once created, is immutable.
    automaticScaling: Automatic scaling is the scaling policy that App Engine
      has used since its inception. It is based on request rate, response
      latencies, and other application metrics.
    basicScaling: A module with basic scaling will create an instance when the
      application receives a request. The instance will be turned down when
      the app becomes idle. Basic scaling is ideal for work that is
      intermittent or driven by user activity.
    betaSettings: Beta settings supplied to the application via metadata.
    creationTime: Creation time of this version. This will be between the
      start and end times of the operation that creates this version.
      @OutputOnly
    defaultExpiration: The length of time a static file served by a static
      file handler ought to be cached by web proxies and browsers, if the
      handler does not specify its own expiration. Only returned in `GET`
      requests if `view=FULL` is set. May only be set on create requests; once
      created, is immutable.
    deployer: The email address of the user who created this version.
      @OutputOnly
    deployment: Code and application artifacts that make up this version. Only
      returned in `GET` requests if `view=FULL` is set. May only be set on
      create requests; once created, is immutable.
    env: The App Engine execution environment to use for this version.
      Default: "1"
    envVariables: Environment variables made available to the application.
      Only returned in `GET` requests if `view=FULL` is set. May only be set
      on create requests; once created, is immutable.
    errorHandlers: Custom static error pages instead of these generic error
      pages, (limit 10 KB/page) Only returned in `GET` requests if `view=FULL`
      is set. May only be set on create requests; once created, is immutable.
    handlers: An ordered list of URL Matching patterns that should be applied
      to incoming requests. The first matching URL consumes the request, and
      subsequent handlers are not attempted. Only returned in `GET` requests
      if `view=FULL` is set. May only be set on create requests; once created,
      is immutable.
    healthCheck: Configure health checking for the VM instances. Unhealthy VM
      instances will be stopped and replaced with new instances. Only returned
      in `GET` requests if `view=FULL` is set. May only be set on create
      requests; once created, is immutable.
    id: The relative name/path of the Version within the module.  Example:
      "v1". Version specifiers can contain lowercase letters, digits, and
      hyphens. It cannot begin with the prefix `ah-` and the names `default`
      and `latest` are reserved and cannot be used.
    inboundServices: Before an application can receive email or XMPP messages,
      the application must be configured to enable the service.
    instanceClass: The frontend instance class to use to run this app. Valid
      values are `[F1, F2, F4, F4_1G]`.  Default: "F1"
    libraries: Configuration for Python runtime third-party libraries required
      by the application. Only returned in `GET` requests if `view=FULL` is
      set. May only be set on create requests; once created, is immutable.
    manualScaling: A module with manual scaling runs continuously, allowing
      you to perform complex initialization and rely on the state of its
      memory over time.
    name: The full path to the Version resource in the API.  Example:
      "apps/myapp/modules/default/versions/v1".  @OutputOnly
    network: Used to specify extra network settings (for VM runtimes only).
    nobuildFilesRegex: Go only. Files that match this pattern will not be
      built into the app. May only be set on create requests.
    resources: Used to specify how many machine resources an app version needs
      (for VM runtimes only).
    runtime: The desired runtime. Values can include python27, java7, go, etc.
    servingStatus: The current serving status of this version. Only `SERVING`
      versions will have instances created or billed for.  If this field is
      unset when a version is created, `SERVING` status will be assumed. It is
      an error to explicitly set this field to `SERVING_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED`.
    threadsafe: If true, multiple requests can be dispatched to the app at
      once.
    vm: Whether to deploy this app in a VM container (deprecated, use
      "env":"2").
