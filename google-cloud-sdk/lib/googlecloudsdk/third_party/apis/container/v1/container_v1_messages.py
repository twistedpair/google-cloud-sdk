    desiredLocations: The desired list of Google Compute Engine
      [locations](/compute/docs/zones#available) in which the cluster's nodes
      should be located. Changing the locations a cluster is in will result in
      nodes being either created or removed from the cluster, depending on
      whether locations are being added or removed.  This list must always
      include the cluster's primary zone.

      "none" - no metrics will be exported from the cluster

      identify valid sources or targets for network firewalls and are
      specified by the client during cluster or node pool creation. Each tag
