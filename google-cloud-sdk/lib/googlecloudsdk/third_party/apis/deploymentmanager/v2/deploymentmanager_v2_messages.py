      fingerprint is a randomly generated value that must be provided with
      update(), stop(), and cancelPreview() requests to perform optimistic
      locking. This ensures optimistic concurrency so that only one request
      happens at a time.  The fingerprint is initially generated by Deployment
      Manager and changes after every request to modify data. To get the
      latest fingerprint value, perform a get() request to a deployment.
    id: [Output Only] Unique identifier for the resource; defined by the
      server.
    insertTime: [Output Only] Timestamp when the deployment was created, in
      RFC3339 text format .
    labels: Map of labels; provided by the client when the resource is created
      or updated. Specifically: Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters
      long and must conform to the following regular expression:
      [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? Label values must be between 0 and 63

      ([a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)?
    manifest: [Output Only] URL of the manifest representing the last manifest

    name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    operation: [Output Only] The Operation that most recently ran, or is
      currently running, on this deployment.

      must match the entire field.  For example, to filter for instances that
      do not have a name of example-instance, you would use name ne example-
      instance.  You can filter on nested fields. For example, you could
      filter on instances that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field
      to true. Use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of labels to
      organize and search for results based on label values.  To filter on
      multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
