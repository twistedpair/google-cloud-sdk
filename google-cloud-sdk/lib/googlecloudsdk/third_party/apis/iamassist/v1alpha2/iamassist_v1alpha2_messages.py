      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.  If no `etag` is provided in the call to `setIamPolicy`, then
      the existing policy is overwritten.

  defined as a proto message field in `AttributeContext`. The field type

  For example, the attribute `source.ip` maps to field
  `AttributeContext.source.ip`.  This message definition is guaranteed not to

    origin: The origin of a network activity. In a multi hop network activity,
      the origin represents the sender of the first hop. For the first hop,
