A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both.

For example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make the request again with the same request ID, the server can check to see whether the original operation was received. If it was, the server ignores the second request. This behavior prevents clients from mistakenly creating duplicate commitments.
