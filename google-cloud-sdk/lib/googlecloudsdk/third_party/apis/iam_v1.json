A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/iam\/help\/conditions\/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles\/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles\/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles\/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles\/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/iam\/docs\/).",

You can reference this value in IAM bindings. This is also the subject that appears in Cloud Logging logs. This is a required field and the mapped subject cannot exceed 127 bytes. * `google.groups`: Groups the authenticating user belongs to. You can grant groups access to resources using an IAM `principalSet` binding; access applies to all members of the group. * `google.display_name`: The name of the authenticated user. This is an optional field and the mapped display name cannot exceed 100 bytes. If not set, `google.subject` will be displayed instead. This attribute cannot be referenced in IAM bindings. * `google.profile_photo`: The URL that specifies the authenticated user's thumbnail photo. This is an optional field. When set, the image will be visible as the user's profile picture. If not set, a generic user icon will be displayed instead. This attribute cannot be referenced in IAM bindings. You can also provide custom attributes by specifying `attribute.{custom_attribute}`, where {custom_attribute} is the name of the custom attribute to be mapped. You can define a maximum of 50 custom attributes. The maximum length of a mapped attribute key is 100 characters, and the key may only contain the characters [a-z0-9_]. You can reference these attributes in IAM policies to define fine-grained access for a workforce pool to Google Cloud resources. For example: * `google.subject`: `principal:\/\/iam.googleapis.com\/locations\/global\/workforcePools\/{pool}\/subject\/{value}` * `google.groups`: `principalSet:\/\/iam.googleapis.com\/locations\/global\/workforcePools\/{pool}\/group\/{value}` * `attribute.{custom_attribute}`: `principalSet:\/\/iam.googleapis.com\/locations\/global\/workforcePools\/{pool}\/attribute.{custom_attribute}\/{value}` Each value must be a [Common Expression Language] (https:\/\/opensource.google\/projects\/cel) function that maps an identity provider credential to the normalized attribute specified by the corresponding map key. You can use the `assertion` keyword in the expression to access a JSON representation of the authentication credential issued by the provider. The maximum length of an attribute mapping expression is 2048 characters. When evaluated, the total size of all mapped attributes must not exceed 8KB. For OIDC providers, you must supply a custom mapping that includes the `google.subject` attribute.

Each key must be a string specifying the Google Cloud IAM attribute to map to. The following keys are supported: * `google.subject`: The principal IAM is authenticating. You can reference this value in IAM bindings. This is also the subject that appears in Cloud Logging logs. Cannot exceed 127 bytes. * `google.groups`: Groups the external identity belongs to. You can grant groups access to resources using an IAM `principalSet` binding; access applies to all members of the group. You can also provide custom attributes by specifying `attribute.{custom_attribute}`, where `{custom_attribute}` is the name of the custom attribute to be mapped. You can define a maximum of 50 custom attributes. The maximum length of a mapped attribute key is 100 characters, and the key may only contain the characters [a-z0-9_]. You can reference these attributes in IAM policies to define fine-grained access for a workload to Google Cloud resources. For example: * `google.subject`: `principal:\/\/iam.googleapis.com\/projects\/{project}\/locations\/{location}\/workloadIdentityPools\/{pool}\/subject\/{value}` * `google.groups`: `principalSet:\/\/iam.googleapis.com\/projects\/{project}\/locations\/{location}\/workloadIdentityPools\/{pool}\/group\/{value}` * `attribute.{custom_attribute}`: `principalSet:\/\/iam.googleapis.com\/projects\/{project}\/locations\/{location}\/workloadIdentityPools\/{pool}\/attribute.{custom_attribute}\/{value}` Each value must be a [Common Expression Language] (https:\/\/opensource.google\/projects\/cel) function that maps an identity provider credential to the normalized attribute specified by the corresponding map key. You can use the `assertion` keyword in the expression to access a JSON representation of the authentication credential issued by the provider. The maximum length of an attribute mapping expression is 2048 characters. When evaluated, the total size of all mapped attributes must not exceed 8KB. For AWS providers, if no attribute mapping is defined, the following default mapping applies: ``` { \"google.subject\":\"assertion.arn\", \"attribute.aws_role\": \"assertion.arn.contains('assumed-role')\" \" ? assertion.arn.extract('{account_arn}assumed-role\/')\" \" + 'assumed-role\/'\" \" + assertion.arn.extract('assumed-role\/{role_name}\/')\" \" : assertion.arn\", } ``` If any custom attribute mappings are defined, they must include a mapping to the `google.subject` attribute. For OIDC providers, you must supply a custom mapping, which must include the `google.subject` attribute. For example, the following maps the `sub` claim of the incoming credential to the `subject` attribute on a Google token: ``` {\"google.subject\": \"assertion.sub\"} ```",
