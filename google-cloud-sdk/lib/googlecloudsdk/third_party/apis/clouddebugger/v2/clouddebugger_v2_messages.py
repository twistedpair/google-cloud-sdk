class Breakpoint(_messages.Message):
  """Represents the breakpoint specification, status and results.

  Enums:
    ActionValueValuesEnum: Defines what to do when the breakpoint hits.
    LogLevelValueValuesEnum: Indicates the severity of the log. Only relevant
      when action is "LOG".

  Fields:
    action: Defines what to do when the breakpoint hits.
    condition: A condition to trigger the breakpoint. The condition is a
      compound boolean expression composed using expressions in a programming
      language at the source location.
    createTime: The time this breakpoint was created by the server. The value
      is in seconds resolution.
    evaluatedExpressions: The evaluated expressions' values at breakpoint
      time. The evaluated expressions appear in exactly the same order they
      are listed in the 'expressions' field. The 'name' field holds the
      original expression text, the 'value'/'members' field holds the result
      of the evaluated expression. If the expression can not be evaluated, an
      error text is placed in the value field.
    expressions: A list of read-only expressions to evaluate at the breakpoint
      location. The expressions are composed using expressions in the
      programming language at the source location. If the breakpoint action is
      "LOG", the evaluated expressions are included in log statements.
    finalTime: The time this breakpoint was finalized as seen by the server.
      The value is in seconds resolution.
    id: Breakpoint identifier, unique in the scope of the debuggee.
    isFinalState: When true, indicates that this is a final result and the
      breakpoint state will not change from here on.
    location: The breakpoint source location.
    logLevel: Indicates the severity of the log. Only relevant when action is
      "LOG".
    logMessageFormat: Only relevant when action is "LOG". Defines the message
      to log when the breakpoint hits. The message may include parameter
      placeholders "$0", "$1", etc. These placeholders will be replaced with
      the evaluated value of the appropriate expression. Expressions not
      referenced in "log_message_format" will not be logged. Example:
      "Poisonous message received, id = $0, count = $1" with expressions = [
      "message.id", "message.count" ].
    stackFrames: The stack at breakpoint time.
    status: Breakpoint status. The status includes an error flag and a human
      readable message. This field will usually stay unset. The message can be
      either informational or error. Nevertheless, clients should always
      display the text message back to the user.  Error status of a breakpoint
      indicates complete failure.  Example (non-final state): 'Still loading
      symbols...'  Examples (final state): 'Failed to insert breakpoint'
      referring to breakpoint, 'Field f not found in class C' referring to
      condition, ...
    userEmail: The e-mail of the user that created this breakpoint
    variableTable: The variable_table exists to aid with computation, memory
      and network traffic optimization.  It enables storing a variable once
      and reference it from multiple variables, including variables stored in
      the variable_table itself. For example, the object 'this', which may
      appear at many levels of the stack, can have all of it's data stored
      once in this table.  The stack frame variables then would hold only a
      reference to it.  The variable var_index field is an index into this
      repeated field. The stored objects are nameless and get their name from
      the referencing variable. The effective variable is a merge of the
      referencing veariable and the referenced variable.

class Variable(_messages.Message):
  """Represents a variable or an argument possibly of a compound object type.
  1. A simple variable such as,      int x = 5    is represented as:      {
  name: "x", value: "5" }  2. A compound object such as,      struct T {
  int m1;        int m2;      };      T x = { 3, 7 };    is represented as: {
  name: "x",      members { name: "m1", value: "3" },      members { name:
  "m2", value: "7" }    }  3. A pointer where the pointee was captured such
  as,      T x = { 3, 7 };      T* p = &x;    is represented as: {      name:
  "p",      value: "0x00500500",      members { name: "m1", value: "3" },
  members { name: "m2", value: "7" }    }  4. A pointer where the pointee was
  not captured or is inaccessible such as,      T* p = new T;    is
  represented as:      { name: "p", value: "0x00400400", members { value:
  "<unavailable>" } }    the value text should decribe the reason for the
  missing value.    such as <optimized out>, <inaccessible>, <pointers limit
  reached>.     note that a null pointer should not have members.  5. An
  unnamed value such as,      int* p = new int(7);    is represented as,
  { name: "p", value: "0x00500500", members { value: "7" } }  6. An unnamed
  pointer where the pointee was not captured such as,      int* p = new
  int(7);      int** pp = &p;    is represented as: {      name: "pp",
  value: "0x00500500",      members { value: "0x00400400", members { value:
  "<unavailable>" } }    }  To optimize computation, memory and network
  traffic, variables that repeat in the output multiple times can be stored
  once in a shared variable table and be referenced using the var_index field.
  The variables stored in the shared table are nameless and are essentially a
  partition of the complete variable.  To reconstruct the complete variable
  merge the referencing variable with the referenced variable.  When using the
  shared variable table, variables can be represented as:       T x = { 3, 7
  };      T* p = &x;      T& r = x;    are represented as,      { name: "x",
  var_index: 3 }      { name: "p", value "0x00500500", var_index: 3 }      {
  name: "r", var_index: 3 }    with shared variable table entry #3: {
  members { name: "m1", value: "3" },      members { name: "m2", value: "7" }
  }  Note that the pointer address is stored with the referencing variable and
  not with the referenced variable, to allow the referenced variable to be
  shared between pointer and references.

  Fields:
    members: The members contained or pointed to by the variable.
    name: The name of the variable, if any.
    status: Status associated with the variable. This field will usually stay
      unset. A status of a single variable only applies to that variable or
      expression. The rest of breakpoint data still remains valid. Variables
      might be reported in error state even when breakpoint is not in final
      state.  The message may refer to variable name with "refers_to" set to
      "VARIABLE_NAME". Alternatively "refers_to" will be set to
      "VARIABLE_VALUE". In either case variable value and members will be
      unset.  Example of error message applied to name: "Invalid expression
      syntax".  Example of information message applied to value: "Not
      captured".  Examples of error message applied to value: "Malformed
      string", "Field f not found in class C", "Null pointer dereference".
    value: The simple value of the variable.
    varTableIndex: This is a reference to a variable in the shared variable
      table. More than one variable can reference the same variable in the
      table. The var_index field is an index into variable_table in
      Breakpoint.
