  determines which permission types are logged, and what identities, if any,
  are exempted from logging. An AuditConfig must have one or more
  AuditLogConfigs. If there are AuditConfigs for both `allServices` and a
  specific service, the union of the two AuditConfigs is used for that
  service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the
  exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted. Example Policy with
  multiple AuditConfigs: { "audit_configs": [ { "service": "allServices",

  sampleservice, this policy enables DATA_READ, DATA_WRITE and ADMIN_READ
  logging. It also exempts `jose@example.com` from DATA_READ logging, and
  `aliya@example.com` from DATA_WRITE logging.

      request. If the condition evaluates to `false`, then this binding does
      not apply to the current request. However, a different role binding
      might grant the same role to one or more of the principals in this
      binding. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM
      policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).
    members: Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud
      resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A
      special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with
      or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special
      identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google
      account or a service account. * `user:{emailid}`: An email address that
      represents a specific Google account. For example, `alice@example.com` .
      * `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a service
      account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`. *

class CDNPolicy(_messages.Message):

  Enums:
    CacheModeValueValuesEnum: Optional. Cache modes allow users to control the
      behaviour of the cache, what content it should cache automatically,
      whether to respect origin headers, or whether to unconditionally cache
      all responses. For all cache modes, Cache-Control headers will be passed
      to the client. Use clientTtl to override what is sent to the client.
    SignedRequestModeValueValuesEnum: Optional. Whether to enforce signed
      requests. The default value is DISABLED, which means all content is
      public, and does not authorize access. You must also set a
      signedRequestKeyset to enable signed requests. When set to
      REQUIRE_SIGNATURES, all matching requests will have their signature
      validated. Requests that were not signed with the corresponding private
      key, or that are otherwise invalid (expired, do not match the signature,
      IP address, or header) will be rejected with a HTTP 403 and (if enabled)
      logged.

  Messages:
    NegativeCachingPolicyValue: Optional. Sets a cache TTL for the specified
      HTTP status code. negativeCaching must be enabled to configure
      negativeCachingPolicy. - Omitting the policy and leaving negativeCaching
      enabled will use the default TTLs for each status code, defined in
      negativeCaching. - TTLs must be >= 0 (where 0 is "always revalidate")
      and <= 86400s (1 day) Only HTTP redirection (3xx), client error (4xx),
      and server error (5xx) status codes may be set. Note that when
      specifying an explicit negativeCachingPolicy, you should take care to
      specify a cache TTL for all response codes that you wish to cache. The
      CDNPolicy will not apply any default negative caching when a policy
      exists.

  Fields:
    cacheKeyPolicy: Optional. Defines the request parameters that contribute
      to the cache key.
    cacheMode: Optional. Cache modes allow users to control the behaviour of
      the cache, what content it should cache automatically, whether to
      respect origin headers, or whether to unconditionally cache all
      responses. For all cache modes, Cache-Control headers will be passed to
      the client. Use clientTtl to override what is sent to the client.
    clientTtl: Optional. Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client)
      TTL, separate from the TTL used by the edge caches. Leaving this empty
      will use the same cache TTL for both the CDN and the client-facing
      response. - The TTL must be > 0 and <= 86400s (1 day) - The clientTtl
      cannot be larger than the defaultTtl (if set) - Fractions of a second
      are not allowed. Omit this field to use the defaultTtl, or the max-age
      set by the origin, as the client-facing TTL. When the cache mode is set
      to "USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS" or "BYPASS_CACHE", you must omit this field.
    defaultTtl: Optional. Specifies the default TTL for cached content served
      by this origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL
      (max-age or s-max-age). Defaults to 3600s (1 hour). - The TTL must be >=
      0 and <= 31,536,000 seconds (1 year) - Setting a TTL of "0" means
      "always revalidate" (equivalent to must-revalidate) - The value of
      defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL. -
      Fractions of a second are not allowed. - When the cacheMode is set to
      FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will overwrite the TTL set in all
      responses. Note that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from
      the cache before the defined TTL. Objects that expire will be
      revalidated with the origin. When the cache mode is set to
      "USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS" or "BYPASS_CACHE", you must omit this field.
    maxTtl: Optional. Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content
      served by this origin. Defaults to 86400s (1 day). Cache directives that
      attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage higher than this, or an Expires
      header more than maxTtl seconds in the future will be capped at the
      value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of an s-maxage Cache-Control
      directive. - The TTL must be >= 0 and <= 31,536,000 seconds (1 year) -
      Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate" - The value of maxTtl
      must be equal to or greater than defaultTtl. - Fractions of a second are
      not allowed. When the cache mode is set to "USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS",
      "FORCE_CACHE_ALL", or "BYPASS_CACHE", you must omit this field.
    negativeCaching: Optional. Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to
      be set, in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or
      redirects. This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user
      experience by reducing response latency. By default, the CDNPolicy will
      apply the following default TTLs to these status codes: - HTTP 300
      (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m - HTTP 404 (Not
      Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s - HTTP 405
      (Method Not Found), 414 (URI Too Long), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s These
      defaults can be overridden in negativeCachingPolicy
    negativeCachingPolicy: Optional. Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP
      status code. negativeCaching must be enabled to configure
      negativeCachingPolicy. - Omitting the policy and leaving negativeCaching
      enabled will use the default TTLs for each status code, defined in
      negativeCaching. - TTLs must be >= 0 (where 0 is "always revalidate")
      and <= 86400s (1 day) Only HTTP redirection (3xx), client error (4xx),
      and server error (5xx) status codes may be set. Note that when
      specifying an explicit negativeCachingPolicy, you should take care to
      specify a cache TTL for all response codes that you wish to cache. The
      CDNPolicy will not apply any default negative caching when a policy
      exists.
    signedRequestKeyset: Optional. The EdgeCacheKeyset containing the set of
      public keys used to validate signed requests at the edge. The following
      are both valid paths to an EdgeCacheKeyset resource: *
      projects/project/locations/global/edgeCacheKeysets/yourKeyset *
      yourKeyset signedRequestMode must be set to a value other than DISABLED
      when a keyset is provided.
    signedRequestMode: Optional. Whether to enforce signed requests. The
      default value is DISABLED, which means all content is public, and does
      not authorize access. You must also set a signedRequestKeyset to enable
      signed requests. When set to REQUIRE_SIGNATURES, all matching requests
      will have their signature validated. Requests that were not signed with
      the corresponding private key, or that are otherwise invalid (expired,
      do not match the signature, IP address, or header) will be rejected with
      a HTTP 403 and (if enabled) logged.

        dynamic content (including HTML), will not be cached.
      USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS: Only cache responses with valid HTTP caching
        directives. Responses without these headers will not be cached at

    description: Optional. A human-readable description of the resource.
    failoverOrigin: Optional. The EdgeCacheOrigin resource to try when the
      current origin cannot be reached. After maxAttempts is reached, the
      configured failoverOrigin will be used to fulfil the request. The
      following are both valid paths to an EdgeCacheOrigin resource: *
      projects/my-project/locations/global/edgeCacheOrigins/my-origin * my-
      origin The value of timeout.maxAttemptsTimeout dictates the timeout
      across all origins.
    labels: Optional. Set of label tags associated with the EdgeCache
      resource.
    maxAttempts: Optional. The maximum number of attempts to cache fill from
      this origin. Another attempt is made when a cache fill fails with one of
      the retry_conditions. Once max_attempts to this origin have failed the
      failover_origin will be used, if one is specified. That failover_origin
      may specify its own max_attempts, retry_conditions and failover_origin
      to control its own cache fill failures. The total number of allowed
      attempts to cache fill across this and failover origins is limited to
      four. The total time allowed for cache fill attempts across this and
      failover origins can be controlled with max_attempts_timeout. The last
      valid, non-retried response from all origins will be returned to the
      client. If no origin returns a valid response, an HTTP 502 will be
      returned to the client. Defaults to 1. Must be a value greater than 0
      and less than 4.
    name: Required. Name of the resource; provided by the client when the
      resource is created. The name must be 1-64 characters long, and match
      the regular expression a-zA-Z* which means the first character must be a
      letter, and all following characters must be a dash, underscore, letter
      or digit.
    originAddress: Required. A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or IP
      address reachable over the public Internet, or the address of a Google
      Cloud Storage bucket. This address will be used as the origin for cache
      requests. For example: - FQDN: media-backend.example.com - IPv4:
      35.218.1.1 - IPv6: 2607:f8b0:4012:809::200e - Google Cloud Storage:
      gs://bucketname or bucketname.storage.googleapis.com When providing an
      FQDN (hostname), it must be publicly resolvable (e.g. via Google public
      DNS). It must not contain a protocol (e.g. https://) and it must not
      contain any slashes. When providing an IP address, it must be publicly
      routable. IPv6 addresses should not be enclosed in square brackets.
    port: Optional. The port to connect to the origin on. Defaults to port 443
      for HTTP2 and HTTPS protocols, and port 80 for HTTP.
    protocol: Optional. The protocol to use to connect to the configured
      origin. Defaults to HTTP2, and it is strongly recommended that users use
      HTTP2 for both security & performance. When using HTTP2 or HTTPS as the
      protocol, a valid, publicly-signed, unexpired TLS (SSL) certificate must
      be presented by the origin server.
    retryConditions: Optional. Specifies one or more retry conditions for the
      configured origin. If the failure mode during a connection attempt to
      the origin matches the configured retryCondition(s), the origin request
      will be retried up to maxAttempts times. The failoverOrigin, if
      configured, will then be used to satisfy the request. The default
      retryCondition is "CONNECT_FAILURE". retryConditions apply to this
      origin, and not subsequent failoverOrigin(s), which may specify their
      own retryConditions and maxAttempts. Valid values are: -
      CONNECT_FAILURE: Retry on failures connecting to origins, for example
      due to connection timeouts. - HTTP_5XX: Retry if the origin responds
      with any 5xx response code, or if the origin does not respond at all,
      example: disconnects, reset, read timeout, connection failure, and
      refused streams. - GATEWAY_ERROR: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to
      response codes 502, 503 or 504. - RETRIABLE_4XX: Retry for retriable 4xx
      response codes, which include HTTP 409 (Conflict) and HTTP 429 (Too Many
      Requests) - NOT_FOUND: Retry if the origin returns a HTTP 404 (Not
      Found). This can be useful when generating video content, and the
      segment is not available yet. - FORBIDDEN: Retry if the origin returns a
      HTTP 403 (Forbidden). This can be useful for origins that return 403
      (instead of 404) for missing conent for security reasons.
    timeout: Optional. The connection and HTTP timeout configuration for this
      origin.
    updateTime: Output only. Update timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",

  version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
