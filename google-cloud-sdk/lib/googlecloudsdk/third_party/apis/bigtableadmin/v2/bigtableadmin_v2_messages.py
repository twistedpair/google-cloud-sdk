      if any.
    ResponseValue: The normal response of the operation in case of success.
      If the original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the
      response is `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
      `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
      methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is
      the original method name.  For example, if the original method name is
      `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.

  Fields:
    done: If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in
      progress. If true, the operation is completed, and either `error` or
      `response` is available.
    error: The error result of the operation in case of failure or
      cancellation.
    metadata: Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.  It
      typically contains progress information and common metadata such as
      create time. Some services might not provide such metadata.  Any method
      that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type,
      if any.
    name: The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same
      service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping,
      the `name` should have the format of `operations/some/unique/name`.
    response: The normal response of the operation in case of success.  If the
      original method returns no data on success, such as `Delete`, the
      response is `google.protobuf.Empty`.  If the original method is standard
      `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For other
      methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx` is

class Status(_messages.Message):
  """The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
  different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
  used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
  - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet
  unexpected needs  # Overview  The `Status` message contains three pieces of
  data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be
  an enum value of google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes
  if needed.  The error message should be a developer-facing English message
  that helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized
  user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error
  details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain
  arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error
  detail types in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error
  conditions.  # Language mapping  The `Status` message is the logical
  representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire
  format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different client libraries
  and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it
  will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to
  some error codes in C.  # Other uses  The error model and the `Status`
  message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without
  APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different
  environments.  Example uses of this error model include:  - Partial errors.
  If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,     it may embed
  the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial     errors.  -
  Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
  have a `Status` message for error reporting.  - Batch operations. If a
  client uses batch request and batch response, the     `Status` message
  should be used directly inside batch response, one for     each error sub-
  response.  - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous
  operation     results in its response, the status of those operations should
  be     represented directly using the `Status` message.  - Logging. If some
  API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could     be used
  directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
