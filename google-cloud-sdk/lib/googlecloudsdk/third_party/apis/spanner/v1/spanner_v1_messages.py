class KeyRange(_messages.Message):
  """KeyRange represents a range of rows in a table or index.  A range has a
  start key and an end key. These keys can be open or closed, indicating if
  the range includes rows with that key.  Keys are represented by lists, where
  the ith value in the list corresponds to the ith component of the table or
  index primary key. Individual values are encoded as described here.  For
  example, consider the following table definition:      CREATE TABLE
  UserEvents (       UserName STRING(MAX),       EventDate STRING(10)     )
  PRIMARY KEY(UserName, EventDate);  The following keys name rows in this
  table:      "Bob", "2014-09-23"  Since the `UserEvents` table's `PRIMARY
  KEY` clause names two columns, each `UserEvents` key has two elements; the
  first is the `UserName`, and the second is the `EventDate`.  Key ranges with
  multiple components are interpreted lexicographically by component using the
  table or index key's declared sort order. For example, the following range
  returns all events for user `"Bob"` that occurred in the year 2015:
  "start_closed": ["Bob", "2015-01-01"]     "end_closed": ["Bob",
  "2015-12-31"]  Start and end keys can omit trailing key components. This
  affects the inclusion and exclusion of rows that exactly match the provided
  key components: if the key is closed, then rows that exactly match the
  provided components are included; if the key is open, then rows that exactly
  match are not included.  For example, the following range includes all
  events for `"Bob"` that occurred during and after the year 2000:
  "start_closed": ["Bob", "2000-01-01"]     "end_closed": ["Bob"]  The next
  example retrieves all events for `"Bob"`:      "start_closed": ["Bob"]
  "end_closed": ["Bob"]  To retrieve events before the year 2000:
  "start_closed": ["Bob"]     "end_open": ["Bob", "2000-01-01"]  The following
  range includes all rows in the table:      "start_closed": []
  "end_closed": []  This range returns all users whose `UserName` begins with
  any character from A to C:      "start_closed": ["A"]     "end_open": ["D"]
  This range returns all users whose `UserName` begins with B:
  "start_closed": ["B"]     "end_open": ["C"]  Key ranges honor column sort
  order. For example, suppose a table is defined as follows:      CREATE TABLE
  DescendingSortedTable {       Key INT64,       ...     ) PRIMARY KEY(Key
  DESC);  The following range retrieves all rows with key values between 1 and
  100 inclusive:      "start_closed": ["100"]     "end_closed": ["1"]  Note
  that 100 is passed as the start, and 1 is passed as the end, because `Key`
  is a descending column in the schema.

    metadata: Metadata about the result set, such as row type information.
      Only present in the first response.

      reasons, such as TCP connection loss. If this occurs, the stream of
      results can be resumed by re-sending the original request and including
      `resume_token`. Note that executing any other transaction in the same
      session invalidates the token.
    stats: Query plan and execution statistics for the query that produced
      this streaming result set. These can be requested by setting
      ExecuteSqlRequest.query_mode and are sent only once with the last
      response in the stream.
    values: A streamed result set consists of a stream of values, which might
      be split into many `PartialResultSet` messages to accommodate large rows
      and/or large values. Every N complete values defines a row, where N is
      equal to the number of entries in metadata.row_type.fields.  Most values
      are encoded based on type as described here.  It is possible that the
      last value in values is "chunked", meaning that the rest of the value is
      sent in subsequent `PartialResultSet`(s). This is denoted by the
      chunked_value field. Two or more chunked values can be merged to form a
      complete value as follows:    * `bool/number/null`: cannot be chunked
      * `string`: concatenate the strings   * `list`: concatenate the lists.
      If the last element in a list is a     `string`, `list`, or `object`,
      merge it with the first element in     the next list by applying these
      rules recursively.   * `object`: concatenate the (field name, field
      value) pairs. If a     field name is duplicated, then apply these rules
      recursively     to merge the field values.  Some examples of merging:
      # Strings are concatenated.     "foo", "bar" => "foobar"      # Lists of
      non-strings are concatenated.     [2, 3], [4] => [2, 3, 4]      # Lists
      are concatenated, but the last and first elements are merged     #
      because they are strings.     ["a", "b"], ["c", "d"] => ["a", "bc", "d"]
      # Lists are concatenated, but the last and first elements are merged
      # because they are lists. Recursively, the last and first elements     #
      of the inner lists are merged because they are strings.     ["a", ["b",
      "c"]], [["d"], "e"] => ["a", ["b", "cd"], "e"]      # Non-overlapping
      object fields are combined.     {"a": "1"}, {"b": "2"} => {"a": "1",
      "b": 2"}      # Overlapping object fields are merged.     {"a": "1"},
      {"a": "2"} => {"a": "12"}      # Examples of merging objects containing
      lists of strings.     {"a": ["1"]}, {"a": ["2"]} => {"a": ["12"]}  For a
      more complete example, suppose a streaming SQL query is yielding a
      result set whose rows contain a single string field. The following
      `PartialResultSet`s might be yielded:      {       "metadata": { ... }
      "values": ["Hello", "W"]       "chunked_value": true
      "resume_token": "Af65..."     }     {       "values": ["orl"]
      "chunked_value": true       "resume_token": "Bqp2..."     }     {

      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race

      clock is substantially skewed from Cloud Spanner commit timestamps.
      Useful for reading at nearby replicas without the distributed timestamp
      negotiation overhead of `max_staleness`.
    maxStaleness: Read data at a timestamp >= `NOW - max_staleness` seconds.

      the possible staleness if the local replica has fallen behind.  Note
      that this option can only be used in single-use transactions.
    minReadTimestamp: Executes all reads at a timestamp >=
      `min_read_timestamp`.  This is useful for requesting fresher data than
      some previous read, or data that is fresh enough to observe the effects
      of some previously committed transaction whose timestamp is known.  Note
      that this option can only be used in single-use transactions.
    readTimestamp: Executes all reads at the given timestamp. Unlike other
      modes, reads at a specific timestamp are repeatable; the same read at
      the same timestamp always returns the same data. If the timestamp is in
      the future, the read will block until the specified timestamp, modulo
      the read's deadline.  Useful for large scale consistent reads such as
      mapreduces, or for coordinating many reads against a consistent snapshot
      of the data.

  - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet
  unexpected needs  # Overview  The `Status` message contains three pieces of
  data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be
  an enum value of google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes
  if needed.  The error message should be a developer-facing English message
  that helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized
  user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error
  details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain
  arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error
  detail types in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error
  conditions.  # Language mapping  The `Status` message is the logical
  representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire
  format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different client libraries
  and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it
  will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to
  some error codes in C.  # Other uses  The error model and the `Status`
  message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without
  APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different
  environments.  Example uses of this error model include:  - Partial errors.
  If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,     it may embed
  the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial     errors.  -
  Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
  have a `Status` message for error reporting.  - Batch operations. If a
  client uses batch request and batch response, the     `Status` message
  should be used directly inside batch response, one for     each error sub-
  response.  - Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous
  operation     results in its response, the status of those operations should
  be     represented directly using the `Status` message.  - Logging. If some
  API errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could     be used
  directly after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.

  """# Transactions   Each session can have at most one active transaction at
  a time. After the active transaction is completed, the session can
  immediately be re-used for the next transaction. It is not necessary to
  create a new session for each transaction.  # Transaction Modes  Cloud
  Spanner supports two transaction modes:    1. Locking read-write. This type
  of transaction is the only way      to write data into Cloud Spanner. These
  transactions rely on      pessimistic locking and, if necessary, two-phase
  commit.      Locking read-write transactions may abort, requiring the
  application to retry.    2. Snapshot read-only. This transaction type
  provides guaranteed      consistency across several reads, but does not
  allow      writes. Snapshot read-only transactions can be configured to
  read at timestamps in the past. Snapshot read-only      transactions do not
  need to be committed.  For transactions that only read, snapshot read-only
  transactions provide simpler semantics and are almost always faster. In
  particular, read-only transactions do not take locks, so they do not
  conflict with read-write transactions. As a consequence of not taking locks,
  they also do not abort, so retry loops are not needed.  Transactions may
  only read/write data in a single database. They may, however, read/write
  data in different tables within that database.  ## Locking Read-Write
  Transactions  Locking transactions may be used to atomically read-modify-
  write data anywhere in a database. This type of transaction is externally
  consistent.  Clients should attempt to minimize the amount of time a
  transaction is active. Faster transactions commit with higher probability
  and cause less contention. Cloud Spanner attempts to keep read locks active
  as long as the transaction continues to do reads, and the transaction has
  not been terminated by Commit or Rollback.  Long periods of inactivity at
  the client may cause Cloud Spanner to release a transaction's locks and
  abort it.  Reads performed within a transaction acquire locks on the data
  being read. Writes can only be done at commit time, after all reads have
  been completed. Conceptually, a read-write transaction consists of zero or
  more reads or SQL queries followed by Commit. At any time before Commit, the
  client can send a Rollback request to abort the transaction.  ### Semantics
  Cloud Spanner can commit the transaction if all read locks it acquired are
  still valid at commit time, and it is able to acquire write locks for all
  writes. Cloud Spanner can abort the transaction for any reason. If a commit
  attempt returns `ABORTED`, Cloud Spanner guarantees that the transaction has
  not modified any user data in Cloud Spanner.  Unless the transaction
  commits, Cloud Spanner makes no guarantees about how long the transaction's
  locks were held for. It is an error to use Cloud Spanner locks for any sort
  of mutual exclusion other than between Cloud Spanner transactions
  themselves.  ### Retrying Aborted Transactions  When a transaction aborts,
  the application can choose to retry the whole transaction again. To maximize
  the chances of successfully committing the retry, the client should execute
  the retry in the same session as the original attempt. The original
  session's lock priority increases with each consecutive abort, meaning that
  each attempt has a slightly better chance of success than the previous.
  Under some circumstances (e.g., many transactions attempting to modify the
  same row(s)), a transaction can abort many times in a short period before
  successfully committing. Thus, it is not a good idea to cap the number of
  retries a transaction can attempt; instead, it is better to limit the total
  amount of wall time spent retrying.  ### Idle Transactions  A transaction is
  considered idle if it has no outstanding reads or SQL queries and has not
  started a read or SQL query within the last 10 seconds. Idle transactions
  can be aborted by Cloud Spanner so that they don't hold on to locks
  indefinitely. In that case, the commit will fail with error `ABORTED`.  If
  this behavior is undesirable, periodically executing a simple SQL query in
  the transaction (e.g., `SELECT 1`) prevents the transaction from becoming
  idle.  ## Snapshot Read-Only Transactions  Snapshot read-only transactions
  provides a simpler method than locking read-write transactions for doing
  several consistent reads. However, this type of transaction does not support
  writes.  Snapshot transactions do not take locks. Instead, they work by
  choosing a Cloud Spanner timestamp, then executing all reads at that
  timestamp. Since they do not acquire locks, they do not block concurrent
  read-write transactions.  Unlike locking read-write transactions, snapshot
  read-only transactions never abort. They can fail if the chosen read
  timestamp is garbage collected; however, the default garbage collection
  policy is generous enough that most applications do not need to worry about
  this in practice.  Snapshot read-only transactions do not need to call
  Commit or Rollback (and in fact are not permitted to do so).  To execute a
  snapshot transaction, the client specifies a timestamp bound, which tells
  Cloud Spanner how to choose a read timestamp.  The types of timestamp bound
  are:    - Strong (the default).   - Bounded staleness.   - Exact staleness.
  If the Cloud Spanner database to be read is geographically distributed,
  stale read-only transactions can execute more quickly than strong or read-
  write transaction, because they are able to execute far from the leader
  replica.  Each type of timestamp bound is discussed in detail below.  ###
  Strong  Strong reads are guaranteed to see the effects of all transactions
  that have committed before the start of the read. Furthermore, all rows
  yielded by a single read are consistent with each other -- if any part of
  the read observes a transaction, all parts of the read see the transaction.
  Strong reads are not repeatable: two consecutive strong read-only
  transactions might return inconsistent results if there are concurrent
  writes. If consistency across reads is required, the reads should be
  executed within a transaction or at an exact read timestamp.  See
  TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.strong.  ### Exact Staleness  These timestamp
  bounds execute reads at a user-specified timestamp. Reads at a timestamp are
  guaranteed to see a consistent prefix of the global transaction history:
  they observe modifications done by all transactions with a commit timestamp
  <= the read timestamp, and observe none of the modifications done by
  transactions with a larger commit timestamp. They will block until all
  conflicting transactions that may be assigned commit timestamps <= the read
  timestamp have finished.  The timestamp can either be expressed as an
  absolute Cloud Spanner commit timestamp or a staleness relative to the
  current time.  These modes do not require a "negotiation phase" to pick a
  timestamp. As a result, they execute slightly faster than the equivalent
  boundedly stale concurrency modes. On the other hand, boundedly stale reads
  usually return fresher results.  See
  TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.read_timestamp and
  TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.exact_staleness.  ### Bounded Staleness  Bounded
  staleness modes allow Cloud Spanner to pick the read timestamp, subject to a
  user-provided staleness bound. Cloud Spanner chooses the newest timestamp
  within the staleness bound that allows execution of the reads at the closest
  available replica without blocking.  All rows yielded are consistent with
  each other -- if any part of the read observes a transaction, all parts of
  the read see the transaction. Boundedly stale reads are not repeatable: two
  stale reads, even if they use the same staleness bound, can execute at
  different timestamps and thus return inconsistent results.  Boundedly stale
  reads execute in two phases: the first phase negotiates a timestamp among
  all replicas needed to serve the read. In the second phase, reads are
  executed at the negotiated timestamp.  As a result of the two phase
  execution, bounded staleness reads are usually a little slower than
  comparable exact staleness reads. However, they are typically able to return
  fresher results, and are more likely to execute at the closest replica.
  Because the timestamp negotiation requires up-front knowledge of which rows
  will be read, it can only be used with single-use read-only transactions.
  See TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.max_staleness and
  TransactionOptions.ReadOnly.min_read_timestamp.  ### Old Read Timestamps and
  Garbage Collection  Cloud Spanner continuously garbage collects deleted and
  overwritten data in the background to reclaim storage space. This process is
  known as "version GC". By default, version GC reclaims versions after they
  are one hour old. Because of this, Cloud Spanner cannot perform reads at
  read timestamps more than one hour in the past. This restriction also
  applies to in-progress reads and/or SQL queries whose timestamp become too
  old while executing. Reads and SQL queries with too-old read timestamps fail
  with the error `FAILED_PRECONDITION`.
