  service: the log_types specified in each AuditConfig are enabled, and the
  exempted_members in each AuditLogConfig are exempted. Example Policy with

  logging. It also exempts `jose@example.com` from DATA_READ logging, and
  `aliya@example.com` from DATA_WRITE logging.

      not apply to the current request. However, a different role binding

      policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-

    members: Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud

      identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google

    Values:
      NO_ATTR: Default non-attribute.
      AUTHORITY: Either principal or (if present) authority selector.
      ATTRIBUTION: The principal (even if an authority selector is present),
        which must only be used for attribution, not authorization.
      SECURITY_REALM: Any of the security realms in the IAMContext
        (go/security-realms). When used with IN, the condition indicates "any
        of the request's realms match one of the given values; with NOT_IN,
        "none of the realms match any of the given values". Note that a value
        can be: - 'self:campus' (i.e., clients that are in the same campus) -
        'self:metro' (i.e., clients that are in the same metro) - 'self:cloud-
        region' (i.e., allow connections from clients that are in the same
        cloud region) - 'self:prod-region' (i.e., allow connections from
        clients that are in the same prod region) - 'guardians' (i.e., allow
        connections from its guardian realms. See go/security-realms-
        glossary#guardian for more information.) - 'self' [DEPRECATED] (i.e.,
        allow connections from clients that are in the same security realm,
        which is currently but not guaranteed to be campus-sized) - a realm
        (e.g., 'campus-abc') - a realm group (e.g., 'realms-for-borg-cell-xx',
        see: go/realm-groups) A match is determined by a realm group
        membership check performed by a RealmAclRep object (go/realm-acl-
        howto). It is not permitted to grant access based on the *absence* of
        a realm, so realm conditions can only be used in a "positive" context
        (e.g., ALLOW/IN or DENY/NOT_IN).
      APPROVER: An approver (distinct from the requester) that has authorized
        this request. When used with IN, the condition indicates that one of
        the approvers associated with the request matches the specified
        principal, or is a member of the specified group. Approvers can only
        grant additional access, and are thus only used in a strictly positive
        context (e.g. ALLOW/IN or DENY/NOT_IN).
      JUSTIFICATION_TYPE: What types of justifications have been supplied with
        this request. String values should match enum names from
        security.credentials.JustificationType, e.g. "MANUAL_STRING". It is
        not permitted to grant access based on the *absence* of a
        justification, so justification conditions can only be used in a
        "positive" context (e.g., ALLOW/IN or DENY/NOT_IN). Multiple
        justifications, e.g., a Buganizer ID and a manually-entered reason,
        are normal and supported.
      CREDENTIALS_TYPE: What type of credentials have been supplied with this
        request. String values should match enum names from
        security_loas_l2.CredentialsType - currently, only
        CREDS_TYPE_EMERGENCY is supported. It is not permitted to grant access
        based on the *absence* of a credentials type, so the conditions can
        only be used in a "positive" context (e.g., ALLOW/IN or DENY/NOT_IN).

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: -
  user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com -
  serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role:
  roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable

  version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    rules: If more than one rule is specified, the rules are applied in the
      following manner: - All matching LOG rules are always applied. - If any
      DENY/DENY_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is denied. Logging will be
      applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. - Otherwise, if
      any ALLOW/ALLOW_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is granted. Logging
      will be applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. -
      Otherwise, if no rule applies, permission is denied.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
