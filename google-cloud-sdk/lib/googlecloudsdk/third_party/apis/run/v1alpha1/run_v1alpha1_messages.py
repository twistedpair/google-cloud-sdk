    creationTimestamp: (Optional) CreationTimestamp is a timestamp
      representing the server time when this object was created. It is not
      guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations.

      is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This

      sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod.
      After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal
      (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the
      API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist

      returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This
