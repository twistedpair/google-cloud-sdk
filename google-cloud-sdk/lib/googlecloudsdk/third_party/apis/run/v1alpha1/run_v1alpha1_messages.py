    clusterName: Not currently supported by Cloud Run. The name of the cluster

    deletionTimestamp: DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which
      this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a
      graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable
      by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
      from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this
      field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list
      contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set,
      this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although
      it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
      For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The
      Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the
      containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a
      hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
      remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this
      object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or
      automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not
      set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested. Populated

      returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This
      value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has
      the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the
      length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server. If
      this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will
