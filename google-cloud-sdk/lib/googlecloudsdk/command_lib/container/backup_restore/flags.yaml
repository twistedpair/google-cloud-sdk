  api_field: backup.deleteLockDays
  type: int
  help_text: |
    Delete lock days specifies the number of days from the create_time of this
    Backup before which deletion will be blocked. For automatically created
    Backup from schedule, this field will be set to the
    backupPlan.retentionPolicy.backupDeleteBlockDays.
    Manual creation of a backup with this field unspecified causes the service
    to use the value of backupPlan.RetentionPolicy.backupDeleteBlockDays.
    Creation of a backup with this field set to a value SMALLER than
    backupPlan.RetentionPolicy.backupDeleteBlockDays results in an invalid
    response from the service.
    This field MUST be an int value between 0-90(inclusive).
    This field may only be INCREASED in an update command, or an invalid
    response will be returned by the service.

  type: int
  help_text: |
    Retain days specifies the desired number of days from the createTime of
    this backup after which it will be automatically deleted.
    If not specified or set to 0, it means the backup will NOT be automatically
    deleted.
    For automatically created backup from schedule, this field will be set to
    the backupPlan.retentionPolicy.backupRetainDays.
    Manual creation of a backup with this field unspecified causes the service
    to use the value of backupPlan.retentionPolicy.backupRetainDays.
    Creation of a Backup with this field set to a value SMALLER than
    delete_lock_days results in an invalid response from the service.
    This field may ONLY be increased in an Update request, or an invalid
    response will be returned by the service immediately.

      corresponding volume backup data in the Backup.
  - arg_value: reuse-volume-handle-from-backup
    help_text: |
      Selecting 'reuse-volume-handle-from-backup' means a PV will be pre-provisioned using the
      volume handle of the original PV in the Backup.
  - arg_value: no-volume-data-restoration
    help_text: |
      Selecting 'no-volume-data-restoration' means PV will not be restored. The restoration will
      ONLY restore selected PVCs and expects corresponding Kubernetes controllers to either
      dynamically provision blank PVs or bind them to pre-provisioned PVs created out-of-band.

cluster_resource_conflict_policy:
  arg_name: cluster-resource-conflict-policy

  help_text: |
    Define how to handle restore-time conflicts for cluster-scoped resources.
  choices:
  - arg_value: use-existing-version
    help_text: |
      Selecting 'use-existing-version' means no conflicting resources will be restored.
  - arg_value: use-backup-version
    help_text: |
      Selecting 'use-existing-version' means deleting the existing version of the conflicting
      resources before re-creating them from the Backup.

      Note that this is a dangerous option which
      could cause unintentional data loss if used inappropriately. For example, deleting a CRD will
      cause Kubernetes to delete all CRs of that type.

namespaced_resource_restore_mode:
  arg_name: namespaced-resource-restore-mode
  api_field: restorePlan.restoreConfig.namespacedResourceRestoreMode
  help_text: |
    Define how to handle restore-time conflicts for namespaced resources.
  choices:
  - arg_value: delete-and-restore
    help_text: |
      When conflicting top-level resources (either Namespaces or ProtectedApplications, depending
      upon the scope) are encountered, this will first trigger a delete of the conflicting resource
      AND ALL OF ITS REFERENCED RESOURCES (e.g., all resources in the Namespace or all resources
      referenced by the ProtectedApplication) before restoring the resources from the Backup. This
      mode should only be used when you are intending to revert some portion of a cluster to an
      earlier state.
  - arg_value: fail-on-conflict
    help_text: |
      If conflicting top-level resources (either Namespaces or ProtectedApplications, depending upon
      the scope) are encountered at the beginning of a restore process, the Restore will fail. If a
      conflict occurs during the restore process itself (e.g., because an out of band process
      creates conflicting resources), a conflict will be reported.
  - arg_value: merge-skip-on-conflict
    help_text: |
      This mode merges the backup and the target cluster and skips the conflicting resources. If a
      single resource to restore exists in the cluster before restoration, the resource will be
      skipped, otherwise it will be restored.
  - arg_value: merge-replace-volume-on-conflict
    help_text: |
      This mode merges the backup and the target cluster and skips the conflicting resources except
      volume data. If a PVC to restore already exists, this mode will restore/reconnect the volume
      without overwriting the PVC. It is similar to MERGE_SKIP_ON_CONFLICT except that it will apply
      the volume data policy for the conflicting PVCs
      "RESTORE_VOLUME_DATA_FROM_BACKUP:" restore data only and respect the reclaim policy of the
      original PV;
      "REUSE_VOLUME_HANDLE_FROM_BACKUP:" reconnect and respect the reclaim policy of the original
      PV;
      "NO_VOLUME_DATA_RESTORATION:" new provision and respect the reclaim policy of the original PV.
      Note that this mode could cause data loss as the original PV can be retained or deleted
      depending on its reclaim policy.
  - arg_value: merge-replace-on-conflict
    help_text: |
      This mode merges the backup and the target cluster and replaces the conflicting resources with
      the ones in the backup. If a single resource to restore exists in the cluster before
      restoration, the resource will be replaced with the one from the backup. To replace an
      existing resource, the first attempt is to update the resource to match the one from the
      backup; if the update fails, the second attempt is to delete the resource and restore it from
      the backup. Note that this mode could cause data loss as it replaces the existing resources
      in the target cluster, and the original PV can be retained or deleted depending on its reclaim
      policy.
