  arg_name: accelerator-type
  required: false
  help_text: |
    TPU accelerator type for the TPU.
    If not specified, this defaults to `v2-8`.

    For a list of available accelerator types run:

    `{parent_command} accelerator-types list`
  type: googlecloudsdk.command_lib.util.hooks.types:LowerCaseType
  default: 'v2-8'

description:
  api_field: node.description
  arg_name: description
  required: false
  help_text: |
    Text description of the TPU.

network:
  api_field: node.networkConfig.network
  arg_name: network
  required: false
  help_text: |
    Network that this TPU will be a part of.
  default: 'default'

subnetwork:
  api_field: node.networkConfig.subnetwork
  arg_name: subnetwork
  required: false
  help_text: |
    Subnetwork that this TPU will be a part of.

enable_external_ips:
  api_field: node.networkConfig.enableExternalIps
  arg_name: internal-ips
  required: false
  default: false
  type: bool
  processor: googlecloudsdk.command_lib.compute.tpus.tpu_vm.util:InvertBoolean
  help_text: |
    Indicates that the IP addresses for the node should be internal. The default is that external IP
    addresses will be associated with the TPU workers.

version:
  api_field: node.runtimeVersion
  arg_name: version
  required: true
  help_text: |
    Runtime version for the TPU, such as `2.3`.

    For a list of available versions run:

    `{parent_command} versions list`

range: &range
  api_field: node.cidrBlock
  arg_name: range
  help_text: |
    CIDR Range for the TPU.

    The IP range that the TPU will select an IP address from.
    Must be in CIDR notation and a `/29` range, for example
    `192.168.0.0/29`. Errors will occur if the CIDR range has already been
    used for a currently existing TPU, the CIDR range conflicts with any
    networks in the user's provided network, or the provided network is
    peered with another network that is using that CIDR range.

preemptible:
  api_field: node.schedulingConfig.preemptible
  arg_name: preemptible
  type: bool
  default: false
  required: false
  help_text: |
    If provided, the TPU will be preemptible and time-limited. It may be
    preempted to free up resources for standard TPUs, and will only be able
    to run for a limited amount of time.

    Preemptible TPUs cannot be restarted.

reserved:
  api_field: node.schedulingConfig.reserved
  arg_name: reserved
  type: bool
  default: false
  required: false
  help_text: |
    When specified, will attempt to create the TPU node under reservations made in the current
    project. The reservations can be made separately but used in aggregated form. i.e., the user can
    make a reservation of 128 V2 TPUs and later on make another reservation of 128 V2 TPUs then
    creates a v2-256 TPU instance. If there exists no reservation or not sufficient amount of
    reserved cores under the project, the request will fail due to lack of capacity.

service_account:
  api_field: node.serviceAccount.email
  arg_name: service-account
  required: false
  help_text: |
    Email address of the service account. If empty, default Google Compute Engine service
    account will be used.

service_account_scopes:
  api_field: node.serviceAccount.scope
  arg_name: scopes
  type: "googlecloudsdk.calliope.arg_parsers:ArgList:"
  required: false
  help_text: |
    List of comma-separated scopes to be made available for the service account.

labels:
  api_field: node.labels
  arg_name: labels
  type: "googlecloudsdk.calliope.arg_parsers:ArgDict:"
  required: false
  help_text: |
    Resource labels to represent user-provided metadata. See
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/labeling-resources for details.

metadata:
  arg_name: metadata
  type: "googlecloudsdk.calliope.arg_parsers:ArgDict:"
  required: false
  help_text: |
    List of comma-separated metadata key-value pairs for the Cloud TPU VM node.

metadata_from_file:
  arg_name: metadata-from-file
  type: "googlecloudsdk.calliope.arg_parsers:ArgDict:"
  required: false
  help_text: |
    Same as --metadata except the value for the entry will be read from a local file.

tags:
  api_field: node.tags
  arg_name: tags
  type: "googlecloudsdk.calliope.arg_parsers:ArgList:"
  required: false
  help_text: |
    Tags to apply to the TPU Node. Tags are used to identify valid sources or
    targets for network firewalls. See https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/add-remove-network-tags for
    more details.

data_disks:
  api_field: node.dataDisks
  arg_name: data-disk
  type:
    arg_dict:

          enum_value: READ_ONLY
  required: false
  help_text: |
    Additional data disks for the TPU VM.

    This flag must be repeated to provide multiple data disks. For example:

      $ {command} --data-disk source=projects/my-project/zones/us-central1-c/disks/my-disk,mode=read-only

    The following keys are allowed:

    *source*::: Specifies the full path to an existing disk. Required. The disk must be in the same zone.

    *mode*::: Specifies the mode in which to attach this disk. Valid options are 'read-write',
    'read-only'. If not specified, the default is 'read-write'.

enable_secure_boot:
  api_field: node.shieldedInstanceConfig.enableSecureBoot
  arg_name: shielded-secure-boot
  type: bool
  default: false
  required: false
  help_text: |
    Specifies that the TPU instances are created with secure boot enabled. This implicitly makes
    them Shielded VM instances.
