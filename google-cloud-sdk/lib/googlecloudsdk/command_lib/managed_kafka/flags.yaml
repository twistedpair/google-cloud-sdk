cpu:
  api_field: cluster.capacityConfig.vcpuCount
  arg_name: cpu
  help_text: |
    The number of vCPUs to provision for the cluster. The minimum is 3.

memory:
  api_field: cluster.capacityConfig.memoryBytes
  arg_name: memory
  type: googlecloudsdk.core.util.scaled_integer:ParseInteger
  help_text: |
    The memory to provision for the cluster in bytes. The value must be between 1 GiB and 8 GiB
    per vCPU.
    Ex. 1024Mi, 4Gi.

subnets:
  arg_name: subnets
  type: "googlecloudsdk.calliope.arg_parsers:ArgList:"
  help_text: |
    VPC subnets from which the cluster is accessible. Both broker and bootstrap server
    IP addresses and DNS entries are automatically created in each subnet. The subnet must be
    located in the same region as the cluster. The project may differ. A minimum of 1 subnet is
    required. A maximum of 10 subnets can be specified. Use commas to separate multiple subnets.
    The name of the subnet must be in the format
    projects/``PROJECT_ID''/regions/``REGION''/subnetworks/``SUBNET''.

labels:
  api_field: cluster.labels
  arg_name: labels
  metavar: KEY=VALUE
  type: "googlecloudsdk.calliope.arg_parsers:ArgDict:"
  help_text: |
    List of label KEY=VALUE pairs to add.
    Keys must start with a lowercase character and contain only hyphens (-),
    underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers. Values must contain only
    hyphens (-), underscores (_), lowercase characters, and numbers.

  api_field: cluster.gcpConfig.kmsKey
  arg_name: encryption-key
  help_text: |
    The relative resource path of the Cloud KMS key to use for encryption in the form:
    projects/``PROJECT_ID''/locations/``LOCATION''/keyRings/``KEY_RING''/cryptoKeys/``KEY''.
    The key must be located in the same region as the cluster. The key cannot be changed once set.

auto-rebalance:
  api_field: cluster.rebalanceConfig.mode
  arg_name: auto-rebalance
  action: store_true
  help_text: |
    Whether the automatic rebalancing is enabled. If automatic rebalancing
    is enabled, topic partitions are rebalanced among brokers when the number of
    CPUs in the cluster changes. Automatic rebalancing is enabled by default.
    Use --no-auto-rebalance to disable this flag.
  choices:
  - arg_value: true
    enum_value: AUTO_REBALANCE_ON_SCALE_UP
  - arg_value: false
    enum_value: NO_REBALANCE

partitions:
  api_field: topic.partitionCount
  arg_name: partitions
  help_text: |
    The number of partitions in a topic. You can increase the partition count for a topic, but you
    cannot decrease it. Increasing partitions for a topic that uses a key might change how messages
    are distributed.

replication-factor:
  api_field: topic.replicationFactor
  arg_name: replication-factor
  help_text: |
    The number of replicas of each partition. A replication factor of 3 is
    recommended for high availability.

configs:
  api_field: topic.configs
  arg_name: configs
  metavar: KEY=VALUE
  type: "googlecloudsdk.calliope.arg_parsers:ArgDict:"
  help_text: |
    Configuration for the topic that are overridden from the cluster defaults.
    The key of the map is a Kafka topic property name, for example:
    `cleanup.policy=compact`, `compression.type=producer`.

# TODO(b/336117815): Provide hard examples and external docs on this flag.

  arg_name: topics-file
  type: "googlecloudsdk.calliope.arg_parsers:ArgObject:"
  metavar: JSON|YAML|FILE
  help_text: |
    The path to the JSON or YAML file containing the configuration of the topics to be updated for
    the consumer group. This also supports inline JSON or YAML.
