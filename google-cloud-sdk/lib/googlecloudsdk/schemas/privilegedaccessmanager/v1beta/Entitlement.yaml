  etag:
    description: |-
      `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to prevent
      simultaneous updates to the same Entitlement. An`etag` is returned in
      the response to `GetEntitlement` and the caller should put the etag in
      the request to `UpdateEntitlement` so that their change is applied on
      the same version. If this field is omitted or if there is a mismatch
      while updating an entitlement, then the server will reject the
      request.
