  excludeHost:
    description: |-
      If true, requests to different hosts will be cached separately. Note: this
      should only be enabled if hosts share the same origin and content Removing
      the host from the cache key may inadvertently result in different objects
      being cached than intended, depending on which route the first user
      matched.
    type: boolean
  excludedQueryParameters:
    description: |-
      Names of query string parameters to exclude from cache keys. All other
      parameters will be included. Either specify includedQueryParameters or
      excludedQueryParameters, not both. '&' and '=' will be percent encoded and
      not treated as delimiters.

    type: boolean
  includeQueryString:
    description: |-
      If true, include query string parameters in the cache key according to
      includeQueryParameters and excludeQueryParameters. If neither is set,
      the entire query string will be included. If false, the query string
      will be excluded from the cache key entirely.
    type: boolean
  includedHeaderNames:
    description: |-
      Names of HTTP request headers to include in cache keys. The value of
      the header field will be used as part of the cache key. - Header names
      must be valid HTTP RFC 7230 header field values. - Header field names
      are case insensitive - You may specify up to five header names. - To
      include the HTTP method, use ":method" Note that specifying several
      headers, and/or headers that have a large range of values (e.g. per-
      user) will dramatically impact the cache hit rate, and may result in a
      higher eviction rate and reduced performance.
