  faultInjectionPolicy:
    description: |-
      The specification for fault injection introduced into traffic to test
      the resiliency of clients to backend service failure. As part of fault
      injection, when clients send requests to a backend service, delays can
      be introduced on a percentage of requests before sending those
      requests to the backend service. Similarly requests from clients can
      be aborted for a percentage of requests. timeout and retry_policy will
      be ignored by clients that are configured with a
      fault_injection_policy
    $ref: HttpRouteFaultInjectionPolicy.yaml
  redirect:
    description: |-
      If set, the request is directed as configured by this field.
    $ref: HttpRouteRedirect.yaml
  requestHeaderModifier:
    description: |-
      The specification for modifying the headers of a matching request
      prior to delivery of the request to the destination.
    $ref: HttpRouteHeaderModifier.yaml
  requestMirrorPolicy:
    description: |-
      Specifies the policy on how requests intended for the routes
      destination are shadowed to a separate mirrored destination. Proxy
      will not wait for the shadow destination to respond before returning
      the response. Prior to sending traffic to the shadow service, the
      host/authority header is suffixed with -shadow.
    $ref: HttpRouteRequestMirrorPolicy.yaml
  responseHeaderModifier:
    description: |-
      The specification for modifying the headers of a response prior to
      sending the response back to the client.
    $ref: HttpRouteHeaderModifier.yaml
  retryPolicy:
    description: Specifies the retry policy associated with this route.
    $ref: HttpRouteRetryPolicy.yaml
  timeout:
    description: |-
      Specifies the timeout for selected route. Timeout is computed from the
      time the request has been fully processed (i.e. end of stream) up
      until the response has been completely processed. Timeout includes all
      retries.
