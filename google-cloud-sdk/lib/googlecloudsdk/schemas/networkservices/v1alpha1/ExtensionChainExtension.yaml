  allowDynamicForwarding:
    description: |-
      When set to `TRUE`, the response from an extension service is allowed to
      set the `com.google.envoy.dynamic_forwarding` namespace in the dynamic
      metadata. This field is not supported for plugin extensions. Setting it
      results in a validation error.
    type: boolean
  authority:
    description: |-
      The `:authority` header in the gRPC request sent from Envoy to the
      extension service. Required for Callout extensions. This field is not
      supported for plugin extensions. Setting it results in a validation error.
    type: string
  failOpen:
    description: |-
      Determines how the proxy behaves if the call to the extension fails or
      times out. When set to `TRUE`, request or response processing continues
      without error. Any subsequent extensions in the extension chain are also
      executed. When set to `FALSE` or the default setting of `FALSE` is used,
      one of the following happens: * If response headers have not been
      delivered to the downstream client, a generic 500 error is returned to the
      client. The error response can be tailored by configuring a custom error
      response in the load balancer. * If response headers have been delivered,
      then the HTTP stream to the downstream client is reset.
    type: boolean
  forwardHeaders:
    description: |-
      List of the HTTP headers to forward to the extension (from the client or
      backend). If omitted, all headers are sent. Each element is a string
      indicating the header name.
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
  metadata:
    description: |-
      The metadata provided here is included as part of the
      `metadata_context` (of type `google.protobuf.Struct`) in the
      `ProcessingRequest` message sent to the extension server. The metadata
      is available under the namespace `com.google....`. For example:
      `com.google.lb_traffic_extension.lbtrafficextension1.chain1.ext1`. The
      following variables are supported in the metadata:
      `{forwarding_rule_id}` - substituted with the forwarding rule's fully
      qualified resource name. This field is subject to following
      limitations: * The total size of the metadata must be less than 1KiB.
      * The total number of keys in the metadata must be less than 20. * The
      length of each key must be less than 64 characters. * The length of
      each value must be less than 1024 characters. * All values must be
      strings. This field is not supported for plugin extensions. Setting it
      results in a validation error.
    type: object
  name:
    description: |-
      The name for this extension. The name is logged as part of the HTTP
      request logs. The name must conform with RFC-1034, is restricted to
      lower-cased letters, numbers and hyphens, and can have a maximum
      length of 63 characters. Additionally, the first character must be a
      letter and the last a letter or a number.
    type: string
  service:
    description: |-
      The reference to the service that runs the extension. To configure a
      callout extension, `service` must be a fully-qualified reference to a
      [backend service](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/r
      eference/rest/v1/backendServices) in the format:
      `https://www.googleapis .com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/regions/{re
      gion}/backendServices/{bac kendService}` or
      `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{projec
      t}/global/backendServices/{backendService}`. To configure a plugin
      extension, `service` must be a reference to a [`WasmPlugin`
      resource](https://cloud.google.com/service-
      extensions/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.wasmPlugins)
      in the format:
      `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/wasmPlugins/{plugin}` or
      `//net workservices.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{locat
      ion}/wasm Plugins/{wasmPlugin}`. Plugin extensions are currently
      supported for the `LbTrafficExtension` and the `LbRouteExtension`
      resources.
    type: string
  supportedEvents:
    description: |-
      A set of events during request or response processing for which this
      extension is called. This field is required for the
      `LbTrafficExtension` resource. It is optional for the
      `LbRouteExtension` resource. If unspecified `REQUEST_HEADERS` event is
      assumed as supported.
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
      enum:
      - EVENT_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED
      - REQUEST_BODY
      - REQUEST_HEADERS
      - REQUEST_TRAILERS
      - RESPONSE_BODY
      - RESPONSE_HEADERS
      - RESPONSE_TRAILERS
  timeout:
    description: |-
      Specifies the timeout for each individual message on the stream.
      The timeout must be between `10`-`1000` milliseconds. Required for
      callout extensions. This field is not supported for plugin
      extensions. Setting it results in a validation error.
