      The URL of a destination service to which to route traffic. Must refer to
      either a BackendService or ServiceDirectoryService.
    type: string
  weight:
    description: |-
      Specifies the proportion of requests forwarded to the backend referenced
      by the service_name field. This is computed as weight/(sum of all weights
      in this destination list). For non-zero values, there may be some epsilon
      from the exact proportion defined here depending on the precision an
      implementation supports. Weight is not a percentage and the sum of weights
      does not need to equal 100. If only one serviceName is specified and it
      has a weight greater than 0, 100% of the traffic is forwarded to that
      backend. If weight is set to 0, no traffic should be forwarded for this
      entry. If unspecified, weight defaults to 1.
