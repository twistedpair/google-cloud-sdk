      A free-text description of the resource. Max length 1024 characters.
    type: string
  hostnames:
    description: |-
      Service hostnames with an optional port for which this route describes
      traffic. Format: [:] These strings may be literals or patterns. In the
      case of a pattern string, '*' (asterisk) matches any string conforming to
      the regex ([a-z0-9-.]*). In that case, '*' must be the first character and
      must be followed in the pattern by either the character '-' (dash) or the
      character '.' (dot). A single route object may not have multiple GrpcRoute
      objects associated with it that have the same hostname pattern. If an
      attempt is made to associate a GrpcRoute with a duplicated hostname, that
      configuration will be rejected. For example, while it is acceptable for
      GrpcRoutes for the hostnames "*.foo.bar.com" and "*.bar.com" to be
      associated with the same GrpcRoute, it is not possible to associate two
      GrpcRoutes both with "*.bar.com" or both with "bar.com". In the case that
      multiple GrpcRoutes match the hostname, the most specific match will be
      selected. For example, "foo.bar.baz.com" will take precedence over
      "*.bar.baz.com" and "*.bar.baz.com" will take precedence over "*.baz.com".
      If a port is specified, then gRPC clients must use the channel URI with
      the port to match this rule (i.e. "xds://service:123"), otherwise they
      must supply the URI without a port (i.e. "xds://service"). At the moment,
      only exact match of hostnames is supported.

      first matching GrpcRoute.RouteRule will be executed. At least one
      rule must be supplied.
