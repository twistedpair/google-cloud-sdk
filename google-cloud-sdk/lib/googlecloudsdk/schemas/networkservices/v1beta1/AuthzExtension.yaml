      The `:authority` header in the gRPC request sent from Envoy to the
      extension service.

    type: string
  failOpen:
    description: |-
      Determines how the proxy behaves if the call to the extension fails or
      times out. When set to `TRUE`, request or response processing continues
      without error. Any subsequent extensions in the extension chain are also
      executed. When set to `FALSE` or the default setting of `FALSE` is used,
      one of the following happens: * If response headers have not been
      delivered to the downstream client, a generic 500 error is returned to the
      client. The error response can be tailored by configuring a custom error
      response in the load balancer. * If response headers have been delivered,
      then the HTTP stream to the downstream client is reset.
    type: boolean
  forwardAttributes:
    description: |-
      List of the Envoy attributes to forward to the extension server. The
      attributes provided here are included as part of the
      `ProcessingRequest.attributes` field (of type `map`), where the keys are
      the attribute names. Refer to the
      [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/service-extensions/docs/cel-
      matcher-language-reference#attributes) for the names of attributes that
      can be forwarded. If omitted, no attributes are sent. Each element is a
      string indicating the attribute name.

      type: string
  forwardHeaders:
    description: |-
      List of the HTTP headers to forward to the extension (from the
      client). If omitted, all headers are sent. Each element is a string
      indicating the header name.

    items:
      type: string
  labels:
    description: |-
      Set of labels associated with the `AuthzExtension` resource. The

      labels](/compute/docs/labeling-resources#requirements) for Google
      Cloud resources.
    $ref: LabelsValue.yaml
  loadBalancingScheme:
    description: |-
      All backend services and forwarding rules referenced by this
      extension must share the same load balancing scheme. Supported
      values: `INTERNAL_MANAGED`, `EXTERNAL_MANAGED`. For more
      information, refer to [Choosing a load
      balancer](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-
      service).

  metadata:
    description: |-
      The metadata provided here is included as part of the
      `metadata_context` (of type `google.protobuf.Struct`) in the
      `ProcessingRequest` message sent to the extension server. The
      metadata is available under the namespace
      `com.google.authz_extension.`. The following variables are
      supported in the metadata Struct: `{forwarding_rule_id}` -
      substituted with the forwarding rule's fully qualified resource
      name.
    type: object
  name:
    description: |-
      Identifier. Name of the `AuthzExtension` resource in the following
      format: `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/authzExtensio
      ns/{authz_extension}`.
    type: string
  service:
    description: |-
      The reference to the service that runs the extension. Currently
      only callout extensions are supported here. To configure a callout
      extension, `service` must be a fully-qualified reference to a
      [backend
      service](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v
      1/backendServices) in the format:
      `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1 /projects/{project}/regions
      /{region}/backendServices/{backendService}` or `https://www.google
      apis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/global/back
      endServices/{backendService}`.
    type: string
  timeout:
    description: |-
      Specifies the timeout for each individual message on the stream.
      The timeout must be between 10-10000 milliseconds.
    type: string

    description: |-
      The format of communication supported by the callout extension. If
      not specified, the default is `EXT_PROC_GRPC`.
    type: string
