  allowDynamicForwarding:
    description: |-
      When set to `TRUE`, the response from an extension service is allowed to
      set the `com.google.envoy.dynamic_forwarding` namespace in the dynamic
      metadata. This field is not supported for plugin extensions or
      AuthzExtensions. Setting it results in a validation error.
    type: boolean
  authority:
    description: |-
      The `:authority` header in the gRPC request sent from Envoy to the
      extension service. Required for Callout extensions. This field is not
      supported for plugin extensions. Setting it results in a validation error.
    type: string
  failOpen:
    description: |-
      Determines how the proxy behaves if the call to the extension fails or
      times out. When set to `TRUE`, request or response processing continues
      without error. Any subsequent extensions in the extension chain are also
      executed. When set to `FALSE` or the default setting of `FALSE` is used,
      one of the following happens: * If response headers have not been
      delivered to the downstream client, a generic 500 error is returned to the
      client. The error response can be tailored by configuring a custom error
      response in the load balancer. * If response headers have been delivered,
      then the HTTP stream to the downstream client is reset.
    type: boolean
  forwardHeaders:
    description: |-
      List of the HTTP headers to forward to the extension (from the client or
      backend). If omitted, all headers are sent. Each element is a string
      indicating the header name.
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
  metadata:
    description: |-
      The metadata provided here is included as part of the
      `metadata_context` (of type `google.protobuf.Struct`) in the
      `ProcessingRequest` message sent to the extension server. For
      `AuthzExtension` resources, the metadata is available under the
      namespace `com.google.authz_extension.`. For other types of
      extensions, the metadata is available under the namespace
      `com.google....`. For example:
      `com.google.lb_traffic_extension.lbtrafficextension1.chain1.ext1`. The
      following variables are supported in the metadata:
      `{forwarding_rule_id}` - substituted with the forwarding rule's fully
      qualified resource name. This field must not be set for plugin
      extensions. Setting it results in a validation error. You can set
      metadata at either the resource level or the extension level. The
      extension level metadata is recommended because you can pass a
      different set of metadata through each extension to the backend. This
      field is subject to following limitations: * The total size of the
      metadata must be less than 1KiB. * The total number of keys in the
      metadata must be less than 16. * The length of each key must be less
      than 64 characters. * The length of each value must be less than 1024
      characters. * All values must be strings.
    type: object
  name:
    description: |-
      The name for this extension. The name is logged as part of the HTTP
      request logs. The name must conform with RFC-1034, is restricted to
      lower-cased letters, numbers and hyphens, and can have a maximum
      length of 63 characters. Additionally, the first character must be a
      letter and the last a letter or a number. This field is required
      except for AuthzExtension.
    type: string
  observabilityMode:
    description: |-
      When set to `TRUE`, enables `observability_mode` on the `ext_proc`
      filter. This makes `ext_proc` calls asynchronous. Envoy doesn't check
      for the response from `ext_proc` calls. For more information about the
      filter, see: https://www.envoyprox y.io/docs/envoy/v1.32.3/api-
      v3/extensions/filters/http/ext_proc/v3/ext_proc.proto#extensions-
      filters-http-ext-proc-v3-externalprocessor This field is helpful when
      you want to try out the extension in async log-only mode. Supported by
      regional `LbTrafficExtension` and `LbRouteExtension` resources. Only
      `STREAMED` (default) body processing mode is supported.
    type: boolean
  requestBodySendMode:
    description: |-
      Configures the send mode for request body processing. The field can
      only be set if `supported_events` includes `REQUEST_BODY`. If
      `supported_events` includes `REQUEST_BODY`, but
      `request_body_send_mode` is unset, the default value `STREAMED` is
      used. When this field is set to `FULL_DUPLEX_STREAMED`,
      `supported_events` must include both `REQUEST_BODY` and
      `REQUEST_TRAILERS`. This field can be set only for
      `LbTrafficExtension` and `LbRouteExtension` resources, and only when
      the `service` field of the extension points to a `BackendService`.
      Only `FULL_DUPLEX_STREAMED` mode is supported for `LbRouteExtension`
      resources.
    type: string
    enum:
    - BODY_SEND_MODE_FULL_DUPLEX_STREAMED
    - BODY_SEND_MODE_STREAMED
    - BODY_SEND_MODE_UNSPECIFIED
  responseBodySendMode:
    description: |-
      Configures the send mode for response processing. If unspecified, the
      default value `STREAMED` is used. The field can only be set if
      `supported_events` includes `RESPONSE_BODY`. If `supported_events`
      includes `RESPONSE_BODY`, but `response_body_send_mode` is unset, the
      default value `STREAMED` is used. When this field is set to
      `FULL_DUPLEX_STREAMED`, `supported_events` must include both
      `RESPONSE_BODY` and `RESPONSE_TRAILERS`. This field can be set only
      for `LbTrafficExtension` resources, and only when the `service` field
      of the extension points to a `BackendService`.

    enum:
    - BODY_SEND_MODE_FULL_DUPLEX_STREAMED
    - BODY_SEND_MODE_STREAMED
    - BODY_SEND_MODE_UNSPECIFIED
  service:
    description: |-
      The reference to the service that runs the extension. To configure a
      callout extension, `service` must be a fully-qualified reference to a
      [backend service](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/r
      eference/rest/v1/backendServices) in the format:
      `https://www.googleapis .com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/regions/{re
      gion}/backendServices/{bac kendService}` or
      `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{projec
      t}/global/backendServices/{backendService}`. To configure a plugin
      extension, `service` must be a reference to a [`WasmPlugin`
      resource](https://cloud.google.com/service-
      extensions/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.wasmPlugins)
      in the format:
      `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/wasmPlugins/{plugin}` or
      `//net workservices.googleapis.com/projects/{project}/locations/{locat
      ion}/wasm Plugins/{wasmPlugin}`. Plugin extensions are currently
      supported for the `LbTrafficExtension`, the `LbRouteExtension`, and
      the `LbEdgeExtension` resources.
    type: string
  supportedEvents:
    description: |-
      A set of events during request or response processing for which this
      extension is called. For the `LbTrafficExtension` resource, this field
      is required. For the `LbRouteExtension` resource, this field is
      optional. If unspecified, `REQUEST_HEADERS` event is assumed as
      supported. For the `LbEdgeExtension` resource, this field is required
      and must only contain `REQUEST_HEADERS` event. For the
      `AuthzExtension` resource, this field is optional. `REQUEST_HEADERS`
      is the only supported event. If unspecified, `REQUEST_HEADERS` event
      is assumed as supported.
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
      enum:
      - EVENT_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED
      - REQUEST_BODY
      - REQUEST_HEADERS
      - REQUEST_TRAILERS
      - RESPONSE_BODY
      - RESPONSE_HEADERS
      - RESPONSE_TRAILERS
  timeout:
    description: |-
      Specifies the timeout for each individual message on the stream.
      The timeout must be between `10`-`10000` milliseconds. Required
      for callout extensions. This field is not supported for plugin
      extensions. Setting it results in a validation error.
