  excludeHost:
    description: |-
      If true, requests to different hosts will be cached separately. Note: this
      should only be enabled if hosts share the same origin and content Removing
      the host from the cache key may inadvertently result in different objects
      being cached than intended, depending on which route the first user
      matched.
    type: boolean
  excludeQueryString:
    description: |-
      If true, exclude query string parameters from the cache key. If false (the
      default), include the query string parameters in the cache key according
      to includeQueryParameters and excludeQueryParameters. If neither
      includeQueryParameters nor excludeQueryParameters is set, the entire query
      string will be included.
    type: boolean
  excludedQueryParameters:
    description: |-
      Names of query string parameters to exclude from cache keys. All other
      parameters will be included. Either specify includedQueryParameters or
      excludedQueryParameters, not both. '&' and '=' will be percent encoded and
      not treated as delimiters. You may exclude up to 10 query parameters.

    type: boolean
  includedHeaderNames:
    description: |-
      Names of HTTP request headers to include in cache keys. The value of
      the header field will be used as part of the cache key. - Header names
      must be valid HTTP RFC 7230 header field values. - Header field names
      are case insensitive - You may specify up to five header names. - To
      include the HTTP method, use ":method" Refer to the documentation for
      the allowed list of header names. range of values (e.g. per-user) will
      dramatically impact the cache hit rate, and may result in a higher
      eviction rate and reduced performance. You may specify up to 5 header
      names.
