      extension service.

    type: string
  failOpen:
    description: |-
      Determines how the proxy behaves if the call to the extension fails or
      times out. When set to `TRUE`, request or response processing continues
      without error. Any subsequent extensions in the extension chain are also
      executed. When set to `FALSE` or the default setting of `FALSE` is used,
      one of the following happens: * If response headers have not been
      delivered to the downstream client, a generic 500 error is returned to the
      client. The error response can be tailored by configuring a custom error
      response in the load balancer. * If response headers have been delivered,
      then the HTTP stream to the downstream client is reset.
    type: boolean
  forwardHeaders:
    description: |-
      List of the HTTP headers to forward to the extension (from the client). If
      omitted, all headers are sent. Each element is a string indicating the

      Cloud resources.

  loadBalancingScheme:
    description: |-
      All backend services and forwarding rules referenced by this extension
      must share the same load balancing scheme. Supported values:
      `INTERNAL_MANAGED`, `EXTERNAL_MANAGED`. For more information, refer to
      [Backend services overview](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/backend-service).

  metadata:
    description: |-
      The metadata provided here is included as part of the
      `metadata_context` (of type `google.protobuf.Struct`) in the
      `ProcessingRequest` message sent to the extension server. The metadata
      is available under the namespace `com.google.authz_extension.`. The
      following variables are supported in the metadata Struct:
      `{forwarding_rule_id}` - substituted with the forwarding rule's fully
      qualified resource name.
    type: object
  name:
    description: |-
      Identifier. Name of the `AuthzExtension` resource in the following

      ns/{authz_extension}`.
    type: string
  service:
    description: |-
      The reference to the service that runs the extension. To configure a
      callout extension, `service` must be a fully-qualified reference to a
      [backend service](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/r
      eference/rest/v1/backendServices) in the format:
      `https://www.googleapis .com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/regions/{re
      gion}/backendServices/{bac kendService}` or
      `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{projec
      t}/global/backendServices/{backendService}`.
    type: string
  timeout:
    description: |-
      Specifies the timeout for each individual message on the stream. The
      timeout must be between 10-10000 milliseconds.
    type: string
  wireFormat:
    description: |-
      The format of communication supported by the callout extension. If not
      specified, the default is `EXT_PROC_GRPC`.
