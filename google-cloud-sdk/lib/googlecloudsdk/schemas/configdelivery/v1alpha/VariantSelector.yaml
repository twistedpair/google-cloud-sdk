      variant_name_template is a template string that can refer to variables
      containing cluster membership metadata such as location, name, and labels
      to determine the name of the variant for a target cluster. The variable
      syntax is similar to the unix shell variables. For example:
      "echo-${CLUSTER_NAME}-${CLUSTER_LOCATION}" will be expanded to "echo-
      member1-us-central1", "echo-member2-us-west1" for cluster members member1
      and member2 in us-central1 and us-central2 location respectively. If one
      wants to deploy a specific variant, say "default" to all the clusters, one
      can just use "default" (string without any variables) as the
      variant_name_template.
