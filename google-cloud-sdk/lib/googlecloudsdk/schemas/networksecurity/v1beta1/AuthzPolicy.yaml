      Can be one of `ALLOW`, `DENY`, `CUSTOM`. When the action is `CUSTOM`,
      `customProvider` must be specified. When the action is `ALLOW`, only
      requests matching the policy will be allowed. When the action is `DENY`,
      only requests matching the policy will be denied. When a request arrives,
      the policies are evaluated in the following order: 1. If there is a
      `CUSTOM` policy that matches the request, the `CUSTOM` policy is evaluated
      using the custom authorization providers and the request is denied if the
      provider rejects the request. 2. If there are any `DENY` policies that
      match the request, the request is denied. 3. If there are no `ALLOW`
      policies for the resource or if any of the `ALLOW` policies match the
      request, the request is allowed. 4. Else the request is denied by default
      if none of the configured AuthzPolicies with `ALLOW` action match the
      request.
