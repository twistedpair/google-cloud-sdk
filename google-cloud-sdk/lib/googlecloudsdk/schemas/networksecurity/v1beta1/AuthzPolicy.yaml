  action:

      Can be one of ALLOW, DENY, CUSTOM. When the action is CUSTOM,
      customProvider must be specified. When the action is ALLOW, only requests
      matching the policy will be allowed. When the action is DENY, only
      requests matching the policy will be denied. When a request arrives, the
      policies are evaluated in the following order: 1. If there is a CUSTOM
      policy that matches the request, the CUSTOM policy is evaluated using the
      custom authorization providers and the request is denied if the provider
      rejects the request. 2. If there are any DENY policies that match the
      request, the request is denied. 3. If there are no ALLOW policies for the
      resource or if any of the ALLOW policies match the request, the request is
      allowed. 4. Else the request is denied by default if none of the
      configured AuthzPolicies with ALLOW action match the request.
