    description: |-
      Describes the properties of a request's sources. At least one of
      sources or notSources must be specified. Limited to 5 sources. A match
      occurs when ANY source (in sources or notSources) matches the request.
      Within a single source, the match follows AND semantics across fields
      and OR semantics within a single field, i.e. a match occurs when ANY
      principal matches AND ANY ipBlocks match.
