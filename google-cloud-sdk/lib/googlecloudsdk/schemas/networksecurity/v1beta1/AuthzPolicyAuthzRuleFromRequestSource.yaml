      name in the client's certificate. A match happens when any principal
      matches with the rule. Limited to 50 principals per Authorization
      Policy for Regional Internal Application Load Balancer, Regional
      External Application Load Balancer, Cross-region Internal Application
      Load Balancer, and Cloud Service Mesh. Limited to 25 principals per
