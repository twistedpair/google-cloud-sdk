  operations:
    description: |-
      Describes properties of one or more targets of a request. At least one
      of operations or notOperations must be specified. Limited to 1
      operation. A match occurs when ANY operation (in operations or
      notOperations) matches. Within an operation, the match follows AND
      semantics across fields and OR semantics within a field, i.e. a match
      occurs when ANY path matches AND ANY header matches and ANY method
      matches.
