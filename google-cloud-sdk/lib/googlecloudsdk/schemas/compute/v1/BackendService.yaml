  externalManagedMigrationState:
    description: |-
      Specifies the canary migration state. Possible values are
      PREPARE, TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE, and TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC. To
      begin the migration from EXTERNAL to EXTERNAL_MANAGED, the
      state must be changed to PREPARE. The state must be
      changed to TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC before the loadBalancingScheme
      can be changed to EXTERNAL_MANAGED. Optionally, the
      TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE state can be used to migrate traffic by
      percentage using
      externalManagedMigrationTestingPercentage. Rolling back a
      migration requires the states to be set in reverse order.
      So changing the scheme from EXTERNAL_MANAGED to EXTERNAL
      requires the state to be set to TEST_ALL_TRAFFIC at the
      same time. Optionally, the TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE state can be
      used to migrate some traffic back to EXTERNAL or PREPARE
      can be used to migrate all traffic back to EXTERNAL.
    type: string
    enum:

  externalManagedMigrationTestingPercentage:

      Balancer. The value of this field must be in the range [0,
      100]. Session affinity options will slightly affect this
      routing behavior, for more details, see: Session Affinity.
      This value can only be set if the loadBalancingScheme in
      the BackendService is set to EXTERNAL (when using the
      classic Application Load Balancer) and the migration state
      is TEST_BY_PERCENTAGE.

  failoverPolicy:
    description: |-
      Requires at least one backend instance group to be defined

      Load Balancers](https://cloud.google.com/load-

      Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents
      stored in this object. This field is used in optimistic
      locking. This field will be ignored when inserting a
      BackendService. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided
      in order to update the BackendService, otherwise the

      the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a
      BackendService.
    type: string
  haPolicy:
    description: |-
      Configures self-managed High Availability (HA) for
      External and Internal Protocol Forwarding. The backends of
      this regional backend service must only specify zonal
      network endpoint groups (NEGs) of type GCE_VM_IP. When
      haPolicy is set for an Internal Passthrough Network Load
      Balancer, the regional backend service must set the
      network field. All zonal NEGs must belong to the same
      network. However, individual NEGs can belong to different
      subnetworks of that network. When haPolicy is specified,
      the set of attached network endpoints across all backends
      comprise an High Availability domain from which one
      endpoint is selected as the active endpoint (the leader)
      that receives all traffic. haPolicy can be added only at
      backend service creation time. Once set up, it cannot be
      deleted. Note that haPolicy is not for load balancing, and
      therefore cannot be specified with sessionAffinity,
      connectionTrackingPolicy, and failoverPolicy. haPolicy
      requires customers to be responsible for tracking backend
      endpoint health and electing a leader among the healthy
      endpoints. Therefore, haPolicy cannot be specified with
      healthChecks. haPolicy can only be specified for External
      Passthrough Network Load Balancers and Internal
      Passthrough Network Load Balancers.

      (legacy), or httpsHealthChecks (legacy) resource for
      health checking this backend service. Not all backend
      services support legacy health checks. See Load balancer
      guide. Currently, at most one health check can be
      specified for each backend service. Backend services with
      instance group or zonal NEG backends must have a health
      check unless haPolicy is specified. Backend services with
      internet or serverless NEG backends must not have a health
      check. healthChecks[] cannot be specified with haPolicy.

      Only send IPv4 traffic to the backends of the backend
      service (Instance Group, Managed Instance Group,
      Network Endpoint Group), regardless of traffic from
      the client to the proxy. Only IPv4 health checks are
      used to check the health of the backends. This is the
      default setting. - PREFER_IPV6: Prioritize the
      connection to the endpoint's IPv6 address over its
      IPv4 address (provided there is a healthy IPv6
      address). - IPV6_ONLY: Only send IPv6 traffic to the
      backends of the backend service (Instance Group,
      Managed Instance Group, Network Endpoint Group),
      regardless of traffic from the client to the proxy.
      Only IPv6 health checks are used to check the health
      of the backends. This field is applicable to either: -
      Advanced global external Application Load Balancer
      (load balancing scheme EXTERNAL_MANAGED), - Regional
      external Application Load Balancer, - Internal proxy
      Network Load Balancer (load balancing scheme

      This is the default. - LEAST_REQUEST: An O(1)
      algorithm which selects two random healthy hosts
      and picks the host which has fewer active

      balancer implements consistent hashing to
      backends. The algorithm has the property that the
      addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts

  maxStreamDuration:
    description: |-
      Specifies the default maximum duration (timeout)
      for streams to this service. Duration is computed
      from the beginning of the stream until the
      response has been completely processed, including
      all retries. A stream that does not complete in
      this duration is closed. If not specified, there
      will be no timeout limit, i.e. the maximum
      duration is infinite. This value can be overridden
      in the PathMatcher configuration of the UrlMap
      that references this backend service. This field

      Name of the resource. Provided by the client when

      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters

  outlierDetection:
    description: |-
      Settings controlling the ejection of unhealthy
      backend endpoints from the load balancing pool of
      each individual proxy instance that processes the
      traffic for the given backend service. If not set,
      this feature is considered disabled. Results of
      the outlier detection algorithm (ejection of
      endpoints from the load balancing pool and
      returning them back to the pool) are executed
      independently by each proxy instance of the load
      balancer. In most cases, more than one proxy
      instance handles the traffic received by a backend
      service. Thus, it is possible that an unhealthy
      endpoint is detected and ejected by only some of
      the proxies, and while this happens, other proxies
      may continue to send requests to the same
      unhealthy endpoint until they detect and eject the
      unhealthy endpoint. Applicable backend endpoints
      can be: - VM instances in an Instance Group -
      Endpoints in a Zonal NEG (GCE_VM_IP,
      GCE_VM_IP_PORT) - Endpoints in a Hybrid
      Connectivity NEG (NON_GCP_PRIVATE_IP_PORT) -
      Serverless NEGs, that resolve to Cloud Run, App
      Engine, or Cloud Functions Services - Private
      Service Connect NEGs, that resolve to Google-
      managed regional API endpoints or managed services
      published using Private Service Connect Applicable
      backend service types can be: - A global backend
      service with the loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED or EXTERNAL_MANAGED. - A
      regional backend service with the serviceProtocol
      set to HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2 or H2C, and
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED or
      EXTERNAL_MANAGED. Not supported for Serverless
