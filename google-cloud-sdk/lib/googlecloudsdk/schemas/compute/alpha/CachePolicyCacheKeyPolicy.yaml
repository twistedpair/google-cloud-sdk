  excludedQueryParameters:
    description: |-
      Names of query string parameters to exclude in cache keys. All other
      parameters will be included. Either specify excluded_query_parameters or
      included_query_parameters, not both. '&' and '=' will be percent encoded
      and not treated as delimiters.  Note: This field applies to routes that
      use backend services. Attempting to set it on a route that points
      exclusively to Backend Buckets will result in a configuration error. For
      routes that point to a Backend Bucket, use includedQueryParameters to
      define which parameters should be a part of the cache key.

  includeHost:
    description: |-
      If true, requests to different hosts will be cached separately.  Note:
      This setting is only applicable to routes that use a Backend Service.
      It does not affect requests served by a Backend Bucket, as the host is
      never included in a Backend Bucket's cache key. Attempting to set it
      on a route that points exclusively to Backend Buckets will result in a
      configuration error.
    type: boolean
  includeProtocol:
    description: |-
      If true, http and https requests will be cached separately.  Note:
      This setting is only applicable to routes that use a Backend Service.
      It does not affect requests served by a Backend Bucket, as the
      protocol is never included in a Backend Bucket's cache key. Attempting
      to set on a route that points exclusively to Backend Buckets will
      result in a configuration error.
    type: boolean
  includeQueryString:
    description: |-
      If true, include query string parameters in the cache key according to
      included_query_parameters and excluded_query_parameters. If neither is
      set, the entire query string will be included. If false, the query
      string will be excluded from the cache key entirely.  Note: This field
      applies to routes that use backend services. Attempting to set it on a
      route that points exclusively to Backend Buckets will result in a
      configuration error.  For routes that point to a Backend Bucket, use
      includedQueryParameters to define which parameters should be a part of
      the cache key.
    type: boolean
  includedCookieNames:
    description: |-
      Allows HTTP cookies (by name) to be used in the cache key. The
      name=value pair will be used in the cache key Cloud CDN generates.
      Note: This setting is only applicable to routes that use a Backend
      Service. It does not affect requests served by a Backend Bucket.
      Attempting to set it on a route that points exclusively to Backend
      Buckets will result in a configuration error. Up to 5 cookie names can
      be specified.
