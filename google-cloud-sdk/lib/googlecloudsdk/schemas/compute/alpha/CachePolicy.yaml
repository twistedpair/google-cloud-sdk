  cacheBypassRequestHeaderNames:
    description: |-
      Bypass the cache when the specified request headers are matched by name,
      e.g. Pragma or Authorization headers. Values are case-insensitive. Up to 5
      header names can be specified. The cache is bypassed for all
      cachePolicy.cacheMode settings.

  cacheMode:
    description: |-
      Specifies the cache setting for all responses from this route. If not
      specified, the default value is CACHE_ALL_STATIC.
    type: string
    enum:
    - CACHE_ALL_STATIC
    - FORCE_CACHE_ALL
    - USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS
  clientTtl:
    description: |-
      Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) maximum TTL. This is
      used to clamp the max-age (or Expires) value sent to the client. With
      FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of client_ttl and default_ttl is used for
      the response max-age directive, along with a "public" directive. For
      cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-
      age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max- age
      directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also
      ensures a "public" cache-control directive is present. If a client TTL
      is not specified, a default value (1 hour) will be used. The maximum
      allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year).
    $ref: Duration.yaml
  defaultTtl:
    description: |-
      Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this origin for
      responses that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or
      s-maxage). Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate". The value
      of defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL.
      When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL will
      overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed value is
      31,622,400s (1 year). Infrequently accessed objects may be evicted
      from the cache before the defined TTL.
    $ref: Duration.yaml
  maxTtl:
    description: |-
      Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by this
      origin. Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage
      higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL seconds in the
      future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value
      of an s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent to the client
      will not be modified. Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate".
      The maximum allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year). Infrequently
      accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    $ref: Duration.yaml
  negativeCaching:
    description: |-
      Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in order to
      apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects. This can
      reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience by
      reducing response latency. When the cache mode is set to
      CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to
      responses with the specified response code that lack any Cache-
      Control, Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When the cache mode
      is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to all responses
      with the specified response code, and override any caching headers. By
      default, Cloud CDN will apply the following default TTLs to these
      status codes: HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent
      Redirects): 10m HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For
      Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP 405 (Method Not Found), 501 (Not
      Implemented): 60s. These defaults can be overridden in
      negative_caching_policy.
    type: boolean
  negativeCachingPolicy:
    description: |-
      Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status code. negative_caching
      must be enabled to configure negative_caching_policy. Omitting the
      policy and leaving negative_caching enabled will use Cloud CDN's
      default cache TTLs. Note that when specifying an explicit
      negative_caching_policy, you should take care to specify a cache TTL
      for all response codes that you wish to cache. Cloud CDN will not
      apply any default negative caching when a policy exists.

      $ref: CachePolicyNegativeCachingPolicy.yaml
  requestCoalescing:
    description: |-
      If true then Cloud CDN will combine multiple concurrent cache fill
      requests into a small number of requests to the origin.
    type: boolean
  serveWhileStale:
    description: |-
      Serve existing content from the cache (if available) when
      revalidating content with the origin, or when an error is
      encountered when refreshing the cache. This setting defines the
      default "max-stale" duration for any cached responses that do not
      specify a max-stale directive. Stale responses that exceed the TTL
      configured here will not be served. The default limit (max-stale)
      is 86400s (1 day), which will allow stale content to be served up
      to this limit beyond the max-age (or s-maxage) of a cached
      response. The maximum allowed value is 604800 (1 week). Set this
      to zero (0) to disable serve-while-stale.
