      This load balancing policy is applicable only for HTTP connections.
      The affinity to a particular destination host will be lost when one or
      more hosts are added/removed from the destination service. This field
      specifies parameters that control consistent hashing. This field is
      only applicable when localityLbPolicy is set to MAGLEV or RING_HASH.
      This field is applicable to either: - A regional backend service with
      the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and
      load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED. - A global backend
      service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
      Not supported when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that
      is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set
      to true.

      healthy hosts and picks the host which has fewer active
      requests. - RING_HASH: The ring/modulo hash load balancer
      implements consistent hashing to backends. The algorithm
      has the property that the addition/removal of a host from
      a set of N hosts only affects 1/N of the requests. -

      in the PathMatcher configuration of the UrlMap that
      references this backend service. This field is only
      allowed when the loadBalancingScheme of the backend
      service is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
