    - INGRESS
  disabled:
    description: |-
      Denotes whether the firewall policy rule is disabled. When set to true,

      firewall rules and compute#packetMirroringRule for packet mirroring rules.
    type: string
  match:
    description: |-
      A match condition that incoming traffic is evaluated against. If it
      evaluates to true, the corresponding 'action' is enforced.

  priority:
    description: |-
      An integer indicating the priority of a rule in the list. The priority
      must be a positive value between 0 and 2147483647. Rules are evaluated
      from highest to lowest priority where 0 is the highest priority and
      2147483647 is the lowest priority.

      rule.

  securityProfileGroup:
    description: |-
      A fully-qualified URL of a SecurityProfile resource instance. Example:
      https://networksecurity.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{p
      roject}/locations/{location}/securityProfileGroups/my-security-profile-

      or 'mirror'. Cannot be specified for other actions.
    type: string
  targetResources:
    description: |-
      A list of network resource URLs to which this rule applies. This field

      applies only to instances in the VPC network that have one of those
      EFFECTIVE secure tags, if all the target_secure_tag are in INEFFECTIVE
      state, then this rule will be ignored. targetSecureTag may not be set
      at the same time as targetServiceAccounts. If neither
      targetServiceAccounts nor targetSecureTag are specified, the firewall
      rule applies to all instances on the specified network. Maximum number
      of target label tags allowed is 256.
