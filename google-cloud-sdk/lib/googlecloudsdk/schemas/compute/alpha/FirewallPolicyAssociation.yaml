      a positive value between 1 and 2147483647. Firewall Policies are evaluated
      from highest to lowest priority where 1 is the highest priority and
      2147483647 is the lowest priority. The default value is `1000`. If two
      associations have the same priority then lexicographical order on
      association names is applied.
