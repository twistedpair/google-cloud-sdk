  authenticationConfig:
    description: |-
      Reference to the BackendAuthenticationConfig resource from the
      networksecurity.googleapis.com namespace. Can be used in authenticating
      TLS connections to the backend, as specified by the authenticationMode
      field. Can only be specified if authenticationMode is not NONE.
    type: string
  sni:
    description: |-
      Server Name Indication - see RFC3546 section 3.1. If set, the load
      balancer sends this string as the SNI hostname in the TLS connection to
      the backend, and requires that this string match a Subject Alternative
      Name (SAN) in the backend's server certificate. With a Regional Internet
      NEG backend, if the SNI is specified here, the load balancer uses it
      regardless of whether the Regional Internet NEG is specified with FQDN or
      IP address and port. When both sni and subjectAltNames[] are specified,
      the load balancer matches the backend certificate's SAN only to
      subjectAltNames[].
    type: string
  subjectAltNames:
    description: |-
      A list of Subject Alternative Names (SANs) that the Load Balancer verifies
      during a TLS handshake with the backend. When the server presents its
      X.509 certificate to the Load Balancer, the Load Balancer inspects the
      certificate's SAN field, and requires that at least one SAN match one of
      the subjectAltNames in the list. This field is limited to 5 entries. When
      both sni and subjectAltNames[] are specified, the load balancer matches
      the backend certificate's SAN only to subjectAltNames[].
