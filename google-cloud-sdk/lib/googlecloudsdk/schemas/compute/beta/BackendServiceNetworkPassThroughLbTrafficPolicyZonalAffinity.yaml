      This field indicates whether zonal affinity is enabled or not. The
      possible values are: - ZONAL_AFFINITY_DISABLED: Default Value. Zonal
      Affinity is disabled. The load balancer distributes new connections to all
      healthy backend endpoints across all zones. -

      The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. When the ratio of the count of
      healthy backend endpoints in a zone to the count of backend endpoints in
      that same zone is equal to or above this threshold, the load balancer
      distributes new connections to all healthy endpoints in the local zone
      only. When the ratio of the count of healthy backend endpoints in a zone
      to the count of backend endpoints in that same zone is below this
      threshold, the load balancer distributes all new connections to all
      healthy endpoints across all zones.
