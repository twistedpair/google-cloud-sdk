  balancingMode:
    description: |-
      Specifies how to determine whether the backend of a load balancer can
      handle additional traffic or is fully loaded. For usage guidelines, see
      Connection balancing mode.  Backends must use compatible balancing modes.
      For more information, see Supported balancing modes and target capacity
      settings and Restrictions and guidance for instance groups.  Note:
      Currently, if you use the API to configure incompatible balancing modes,
      the configuration might be accepted even though it has no impact and is
      ignored. Specifically, Backend.maxUtilization is ignored when
      Backend.balancingMode is RATE. In the future, this incompatible
      combination will be rejected.

  capacityScaler:
    description: |-
      A multiplier applied to the backend's target capacity of its balancing
      mode. The default value is 1, which means the group serves up to 100% of
      its configured capacity (depending onbalancingMode). A setting of 0 means
      the group is completely drained, offering 0% of its available capacity.
      The valid ranges are 0.0 and [0.1,1.0]. You cannot configure a setting
      larger than 0 and smaller than0.1. You cannot configure a setting of 0
      when there is only one backend attached to the backend service.  Not
      available with backends that don't support using abalancingMode. This
      includes backends such as global internet NEGs, regional serverless NEGs,
      and PSC NEGs.

  failover:
    description: |-
      This field designates whether this is a failover backend. More than
      one failover backend can be configured for a given BackendService.
    type: boolean
  group:
    description: |-
      The fully-qualified URL of aninstance group or network endpoint group
      (NEG) resource. To determine what types of backends a load balancer
      supports, see the [Backend services
      overview](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-
      service#backends).  You must use the *fully-qualified* URL (starting
      withhttps://www.googleapis.com/) to specify the instance group or NEG.
      Partial URLs are not supported.  If haPolicy is specified, backends
      must refer to NEG resources of type GCE_VM_IP.

  preference:
    description: |-
      This field indicates whether this backend should be fully utilized
      before sending traffic to backends with default preference. The
      possible values are:        - PREFERRED: Backends with this preference
      level will be    filled up to their capacity limits first, based on
      RTT. - DEFAULT:  If preferred backends don't have enough    capacity,
      backends in this layer would be used and traffic would be    assigned
      based on the load balancing algorithm you use. This is the    default
