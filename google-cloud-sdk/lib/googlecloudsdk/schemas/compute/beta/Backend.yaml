  balancingMode:
    description: |-
      Specifies how to determine whether the backend of a load balancer can
      handle additional traffic or is fully loaded. For usage guidelines, see
      Connection balancing mode.
    type: string
    enum:
    - CONNECTION
    - RATE
    - UTILIZATION
  capacityScaler:
    description: |-
      A multiplier applied to the backend's target capacity of its balancing
      mode. The default value is 1, which means the group serves up to 100% of
      its configured capacity (depending on balancingMode). A setting of 0 means
      the group is completely drained, offering 0% of its available capacity.
      The valid ranges are 0.0 and [0.1,1.0]. You cannot configure a setting
      larger than 0 and smaller than 0.1. You cannot configure a setting of 0
      when there is only one backend attached to the backend service.  Not
      supported by:  - Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing - Network Load Balancing
    type: number
  description:
    description: |-
      An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you
      create the resource.
    type: string
  failover:
    description: |-
      This field designates whether this is a failover backend. More than one
      failover backend can be configured for a given BackendService.
    type: boolean
  group:
    description: |-
      The fully-qualified URL of an instance group or network endpoint group
      (NEG) resource. The type of backend that a backend service supports
      depends on the backend service's loadBalancingScheme.    - When the
      loadBalancingScheme for the backend service is EXTERNAL (except Network
      Load Balancing),  INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED, or INTERNAL_MANAGED , the backend
      can be either an instance group or a NEG. The backends on the backend
      service must be either all instance groups or all NEGs. You cannot mix
      instance group and NEG backends on the same backend service. - When the
      loadBalancingScheme for the backend service is EXTERNAL for Network Load
      Balancing or INTERNAL for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing, the backend
      must be an instance group. NEGs are not supported.    For regional
      services, the backend must be in the same region as the backend service.
      You must use the fully-qualified URL (starting with
      https://www.googleapis.com/) to specify the instance group or NEG. Partial
      URLs are not supported.
