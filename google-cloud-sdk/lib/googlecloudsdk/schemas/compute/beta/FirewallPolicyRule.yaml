      firewall rules and compute#packetMirroringRule for packet mirroring rules.
    type: string
  match:
    description: |-
      A match condition that incoming traffic is evaluated against. If it
      evaluates to true, the corresponding 'action' is enforced.

  priority:
    description: |-
      An integer indicating the priority of a rule in the list. The priority
      must be a positive value between 0 and 2147483647. Rules are evaluated

  securityProfileGroup:
    description: |-
      A fully-qualified URL of a SecurityProfile resource instance. Example:
      https://networksecurity.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{p

  targetResources:
    description: |-
      A list of network resource URLs to which this rule applies. This field

      EFFECTIVE secure tags, if all the target_secure_tag are in INEFFECTIVE
      state, then this rule will be ignored. targetSecureTag may not be set
      at the same time as targetServiceAccounts. If neither
      targetServiceAccounts nor targetSecureTag are specified, the firewall
      rule applies to all instances on the specified network. Maximum number
      of target label tags allowed is 256.
