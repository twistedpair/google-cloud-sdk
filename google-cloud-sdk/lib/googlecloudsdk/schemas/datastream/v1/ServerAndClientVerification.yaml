  clientCertificate:
    description: |-
      Input only. PEM-encoded certificate used by the source database to
      authenticate the client identity (i.e., the Datastream's identity). This
      certificate is signed by either a root certificate trusted by the server
      or one or more intermediate certificates (which is stored with the leaf
      certificate) to link the this certificate to the trusted root certificate.
    type: string
  clientKey:
    description: |-
      Input only. PEM-encoded private key associated with the client
      certificate. This value will be used during the SSL/TLS handshake,
      allowing the PostgreSQL server to authenticate the client's identity, i.e.
      identity of the Datastream. Mutually exclusive with the
      `secret_manager_stored_client_key` field.
