      Name(SAN)s for a Cloud SQL instance.

    privateNetwork: The resource link for the VPC network from which the Cloud
      SQL instance is accessible for private IP. For example,
      `/projects/myProject/global/networks/default`. This setting can be
      updated, but it cannot be removed after it is set.
    pscConfig: PSC settings for this instance.
    requireSsl: Use `ssl_mode` instead. Whether SSL/TLS connections over IP
      are enforced. If set to false, then allow both non-SSL/non-TLS and
      SSL/TLS connections. For SSL/TLS connections, the client certificate
      won't be verified. If set to true, then only allow connections encrypted
      with SSL/TLS and with valid client certificates. If you want to enforce
      SSL/TLS without enforcing the requirement for valid client certificates,
      then use the `ssl_mode` flag instead of the legacy `require_ssl` flag.

      projects/{PROJECT}/locations/{REGION}/caPools/{CA_POOL_ID}
    serverCertificateRotationMode: Optional. Controls the automatic server
      certificate rotation feature. This feature is disabled by default. When
      enabled, the server certificate will be automatically rotated during

      to six months before it expires. This setting can only be set if
      server_ca_mode is either GOOGLE_MANAGED_CAS_CA or
      CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CAS_CA.
    sslMode: Specify how SSL/TLS is enforced in database connections. If you
      must use the `require_ssl` flag for backward compatibility, then only
      the following value pairs are valid: For PostgreSQL and MySQL: *
      `ssl_mode=ALLOW_UNENCRYPTED_AND_ENCRYPTED` and `require_ssl=false` *

      `require_ssl=false` * `ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY` and `require_ssl=true`
      The value of `ssl_mode` has priority over the value of `require_ssl`.
      For example, for the pair `ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY` and
      `require_ssl=false`, `ssl_mode=ENCRYPTED_ONLY` means accept only SSL
      connections, while `require_ssl=false` means accept both non-SSL and SSL
