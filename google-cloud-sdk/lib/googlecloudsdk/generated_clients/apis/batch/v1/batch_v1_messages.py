  use with the [InstancePolicyOrTemplate](https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/
  reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.jobs#instancepolicyortemplate) field,
  make sure both fields are compatible with each other.

  Fields:
    bootDiskMib: Extra boot disk size in MiB for each task.
    cpuMilli: The milliCPU count. `cpuMilli` defines the amount of CPU
      resources per task in milliCPU units. For example, `1000` corresponds to
      1 vCPU per task. If undefined, the default value is `2000`. If you also
      define the VM's machine type using the `machineType` in [InstancePolicy]
      (https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.location
      s.jobs#instancepolicy) field or inside the `instanceTemplate` in the [In

      st/v1/projects.locations.jobs#instancepolicyortemplate) field, make sure
      the CPU resources for both fields are compatible with each other and

      than `2000`, or you are recommended to run two tasks on the same VM if
      you set `cpuMilli` to `1000` or less.
    memoryMib: Memory in MiB. `memoryMib` defines the amount of memory per
      task in MiB units. If undefined, the default value is `2000`. If you

      container will be blocked, containers that are with
      block_external_network as true can still communicate with each other,
      network cannot be specified in the `container.options` field.
    commands: Required for some container images. Overrides the `CMD`
      specified in the container. If there is an `ENTRYPOINT` (either in the
      container image or with the `entrypoint` field below) then these
      commands are appended as arguments to the `ENTRYPOINT`.
    enableImageStreaming: Optional. If set to true, this container runnable
      uses Image streaming. Use Image streaming to allow the runnable to
      initialize without waiting for the entire container image to download,
      which can significantly reduce startup time for large container images.
      When `enableImageStreaming` is set to true, the container runtime is
      [containerd](https://containerd.io/) instead of Docker. Additionally,
      this container runnable only supports the following `container`
      subfields: `imageUri`, `commands[]`, `entrypoint`, and `volumes[]`; any
      other `container` subfields are ignored. For more information about the
      requirements and limitations for using Image streaming with Batch, see
      the [`image-streaming` sample on
      GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/batch-
      samples/tree/main/api-samples/image-streaming).
    entrypoint: Required for some container images. Overrides the `ENTRYPOINT`
      specified in the container.
    imageUri: Required. The URI to pull the container image from.
    options: Required for some container images. Arbitrary additional options
      to include in the `docker run` command when running this container-for
      example, `--network host`. For the `--volume` option, use the `volumes`
      field for the container.
    password: Required if the container image is from a private Docker
      registry. The password to login to the Docker registry that contains the
      image. For security, it is strongly recommended to specify an encrypted
      password by using a Secret Manager secret:
      `projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*`. Warning: If you specify the password
      using plain text, you risk the password being exposed to any users who
      can view the job or its logs. To avoid this risk, specify a secret that
      contains the password instead. Learn more about [Secret
      Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/) and [using
      Secret Manager with Batch](https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/create-
      run-job-secret-manager).
    username: Required if the container image is from a private Docker
      registry. The username to login to the Docker registry that contains the
      image. You can either specify the username directly by using plain text
      or specify an encrypted username by using a Secret Manager secret:
      `projects/*/secrets/*/versions/*`. However, using a secret is
      recommended for enhanced security. Caution: If you specify the username
      using plain text, you risk the username being exposed to any users who
      can view the job or its logs. To avoid this risk, specify a secret that
      contains the username instead. Learn more about [Secret
      Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/) and [using
      Secret Manager with Batch](https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/create-
      run-job-secret-manager).
    volumes: Volumes to mount (bind mount) from the host machine files or
      directories into the container, formatted to match `--volume` option for
      the `docker run` command-for example, `/foo:/bar` or `/foo:/bar:ro`. If
      the `TaskSpec.Volumes` field is specified but this field is not, Batch
      will mount each volume from the host machine to the container with the
      same mount path by default. In this case, the default mount option for
      containers will be read-only (`ro`) for existing persistent disks and
      read-write (`rw`) for other volume types, regardless of the original
      mount options specified in `TaskSpec.Volumes`. If you need different
      mount settings, you can explicitly configure them in this field.

      interfaces. If not indicated, "NVMe" will be the default one for local
      ssds. This field is ignored for persistent disks as the interface is

      family name: projects/{project}/global/images/family/{image_family} *
      Specify the image version:
      projects/{project}/global/images/{image_version} You can also use Batch
      customized image in short names. The following image values are

      `batch-cos`: use Batch Container-Optimized images. * `batch-hpc-rocky`:
      use Batch HPC Rocky Linux images.
    sizeGb: Disk size in GB. **Non-Boot Disk**: If the `type` specifies a
      persistent disk, this field is ignored if `data_source` is set as
      `image` or `snapshot`. If the `type` specifies a local SSD, this field
      should be a multiple of 375 GB, otherwise, the final size will be the
      next greater multiple of 375 GB. **Boot Disk**: Batch will calculate the
      boot disk size based on source image and task requirements if you do not
      speicify the size. If both this field and the `boot_disk_mib` field in
      task spec's `compute_resource` are defined, Batch will only honor this
      field. Also, this field should be no smaller than the source disk's size

class TaskGroup(_messages.Message):
  r"""A TaskGroup defines one or more Tasks that all share the same TaskSpec.

  Enums:
    SchedulingPolicyValueValuesEnum: Scheduling policy for Tasks in the
      TaskGroup. The default value is AS_SOON_AS_POSSIBLE.

  Fields:
    name: Output only. TaskGroup name. The system generates this field based
      on parent Job name. For example: "projects/123456/locations/us-
      west1/jobs/job01/taskGroups/group01".
    parallelism: Max number of tasks that can run in parallel. Default to
      min(task_count, parallel tasks per job limit). See: [Job
      Limits](https://cloud.google.com/batch/quotas#job_limits). Field
      parallelism must be 1 if the scheduling_policy is IN_ORDER.
    permissiveSsh: When true, Batch will configure SSH to allow passwordless
      login between VMs running the Batch tasks in the same TaskGroup.
    requireHostsFile: When true, Batch will populate a file with a list of all
      VMs assigned to the TaskGroup and set the BATCH_HOSTS_FILE environment
      variable to the path of that file. Defaults to false. The host file
      supports up to 1000 VMs.
    runAsNonRoot: Optional. If not set or set to false, Batch uses the root
      user to execute runnables. If set to true, Batch runs the runnables
      using a non-root user. Currently, the non-root user Batch used is
      generated by OS Login. For more information, see [About OS
      Login](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/oslogin).
    schedulingPolicy: Scheduling policy for Tasks in the TaskGroup. The
      default value is AS_SOON_AS_POSSIBLE.
    taskCount: Number of Tasks in the TaskGroup. Default is 1.
    taskCountPerNode: Max number of tasks that can be run on a VM at the same
      time. If not specified, the system will decide a value based on
      available compute resources on a VM and task requirements.
    taskEnvironments: An array of environment variable mappings, which are
      passed to Tasks with matching indices. If task_environments is used then
      task_count should not be specified in the request (and will be ignored).
      Task count will be the length of task_environments. Tasks get a
      BATCH_TASK_INDEX and BATCH_TASK_COUNT environment variable, in addition
      to any environment variables set in task_environments, specifying the
      number of Tasks in the Task's parent TaskGroup, and the specific Task's
      index in the TaskGroup (0 through BATCH_TASK_COUNT - 1).
    taskSpec: Required. Tasks in the group share the same task spec.

      the lifecycle policy condition is met, the action in the policy will
      execute. If task execution result does not meet with the defined
      lifecycle policy, we consider it as the default policy. Default policy
      means if the exit code is 0, exit task. If task ends with non-zero exit
      code, retry the task with max_retry_count.
    maxRetryCount: Maximum number of retries on failures. The default, 0,
      which means never retry. The valid value range is [0, 10].
    maxRunDuration: Maximum duration the task should run before being
      automatically retried (if enabled) or automatically failed. Format the
      value of this field as a time limit in seconds followed by `s`-for
      example, `3600s` for 1 hour. The field accepts any value between 0 and
      the maximum listed for the `Duration` field type at

      task to succeed, all of its script and container runnables each must

      with a zero status. + The runnable didn't finish, but you enabled its
