class Bucket(_messages.Message):
  r"""A bucket.

  Messages:
    LabelsValue: Optional. User-provided labels, in key/value pairs.

  Fields:
    acl: Optional. Access controls on the bucket. If
      iam_config.uniform_bucket_level_access is enabled on this bucket,
      requests to set, read, or modify acl is an error.
    autoclass: Optional. The bucket's Autoclass configuration. If there is no
      configuration, the Autoclass feature will be disabled and have no effect
      on the bucket.
    billing: Optional. The bucket's billing config.
    bucketId: Output only. The user-chosen part of the bucket name. The
      `{bucket}` portion of the `name` field. For globally unique buckets,
      this is equal to the "bucket name" of other Cloud Storage APIs. Example:
      "pub".
    cors: Optional. The bucket's https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/ (CORS) config.
    createTime: Output only. The creation time of the bucket.
    customPlacementConfig: Optional. Configuration that, if present, specifies
      the data placement for a
      https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations#location-dr.
    defaultEventBasedHold: Optional. The default value for event-based hold on
      newly created objects in this bucket. Event-based hold is a way to
      retain objects indefinitely until an event occurs, signified by the
      hold's release. After being released, such objects will be subject to
      bucket-level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for
      banks to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in
      full. Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan
      being paid in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact
      for any number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold
      on the object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means
      retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based
      hold transitioned from true to false. Objects under event-based hold
      cannot be deleted, overwritten or archived until the hold is removed.
    defaultObjectAcl: Optional. Default access controls to apply to new
      objects when no ACL is provided. If
      iam_config.uniform_bucket_level_access is enabled on this bucket,
      requests to set, read, or modify acl is an error.
    encryption: Optional. Encryption config for a bucket.
    etag: The etag of the bucket. If included in the metadata of an
      UpdateBucketRequest, the operation will only be performed if the etag
      matches that of the bucket.
    generation: Output only. The generation of the bucket.
    hardDeleteTime: Output only. The hard delete time of the bucket.
    hierarchicalNamespace: Optional. The bucket's hierarchical namespace
      configuration. If there is no configuration, the hierarchical namespace
      feature will be disabled and have no effect on the bucket.
    iamConfig: Optional. The bucket's IAM config.
    ipFilter: Optional. The bucket's IP filter configuration.
    labels: Optional. User-provided labels, in key/value pairs.
    lifecycle: Optional. The bucket's lifecycle config. See
      [https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/lifecycle]Lifecycle
      Management] for more information.
    location: Immutable. The location of the bucket. Object data for objects
      in the bucket resides in physical storage within this region. Defaults
      to `US`. See the https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/concepts-
      techniques#specifyinglocations" for the authoritative list. Attempting
      to update this field after the bucket is created will result in an
      error.
    locationType: Output only. The location type of the bucket (region, dual-
      region, multi-region, etc).
    logging: Optional. The bucket's logging config, which defines the
      destination bucket and name prefix (if any) for the current bucket's
      logs.
    metageneration: Output only. The metadata generation of this bucket.
    name: Identifier. The name of the bucket. Format:
      `projects/{project}/buckets/{bucket}`
    objectRetention: Optional. The bucket's object retention configuration.
      Must be enabled before objects in the bucket may have retention
      configured.
    owner: Output only. The owner of the bucket. This is always the project
      team's owner group.
    project: Immutable. The project which owns this bucket, in the format of
      "projects/{projectIdentifier}". {projectIdentifier} can be the project
      ID or project number. Output values will always be in project number
      format.
    retentionPolicy: Optional. The bucket's retention policy. The retention
      policy enforces a minimum retention time for all objects contained in
      the bucket, based on their creation time. Any attempt to overwrite or
      delete objects younger than the retention period will result in a
      PERMISSION_DENIED error. An unlocked retention policy can be modified or
      removed from the bucket via a storage.buckets.update operation. A locked
      retention policy cannot be removed or shortened in duration for the
      lifetime of the bucket. Attempting to remove or decrease period of a
      locked retention policy will result in a PERMISSION_DENIED error.
    rpo: Optional. The recovery point objective for cross-region replication
      of the bucket. Applicable only for dual- and multi-region buckets.
      "DEFAULT" uses default replication. "ASYNC_TURBO" enables turbo
      replication, valid for dual-region buckets only. If rpo is not specified
      when the bucket is created, it defaults to "DEFAULT". For more
      information, see https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/availability-
      durability#turbo-replication.
    satisfiesPzi: Optional. Reserved for future use.
    satisfiesPzs: Optional. Reserved for future use.
    softDeletePolicy: Optional. The bucket's soft delete policy. The soft
      delete policy prevents soft-deleted objects from being permanently
      deleted.
    softDeleteTime: Output only. The soft delete time of the bucket.
    storageClass: Optional. The bucket's default storage class, used whenever
      no storageClass is specified for a newly-created object. This defines
      how objects in the bucket are stored and determines the SLA and the cost
      of storage. If this value is not specified when the bucket is created,
      it will default to `STANDARD`. For more information, see
      https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes.
    updateTime: Output only. The modification time of the bucket.
    versioning: Optional. The bucket's versioning config.
    website: Optional. The bucket's website config, controlling how the
      service behaves when accessing bucket contents as a web site. See the
      https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/static-website for more
      information.

      timestamp set on an object. The value of the field must be a nonnegative
