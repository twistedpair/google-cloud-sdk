      This is used with state-changing methods to prevent accidental
      overwrites when multiple user agents might be acting in parallel on the

      the expected existence of the flag. The Any wildcard (`*`) requires that
      the resource must already exists, and the Not Any wildcard (`!*`)
      requires that it must not.
    flag: A Flag resource to be passed as the request body.
    name: Identifier. The resource name (full URI of the resource) following
      the standard naming scheme:
      "projects/{project}/locations/{location}/flags/{flag_id}"
    requestId: An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique
      request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know
      to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server will
      guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first request. For
      example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the
      request times out. If you make the request again with the same request
      ID, the server can check if original operation with the same request ID
      was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. This prevents
      clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. The request ID
      must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is not supported
      (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
    updateMask: Field mask is used to specify the fields to be overwritten in
      the Flag resource by the update. The fields specified in the update_mask
      are relative to the resource, not the full request. A field will be
      overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user does not provide a mask
      then all fields in the Flag will be overwritten.

    cancel: Optional. When true, attempt to cancel the operation. Cancellation
      may fail if the operation is already executing. (Optional)
    conditions: Optional. Output only. A set of conditions which indicate the
      various conditions this resource can have.
    createTime: Output only. The timestamp when the resource was created.
    deprovision: A Deprovision attribute.
    engineState: Optional. Output only. The engine state for on-going
      deployment engine operation(s). This field is opaque for external usage.
    errorCategory: Optional. Output only. UnitOperationErrorCategory describe
      the error category.
    etag: Output only. An opaque value that uniquely identifies a version or
      generation of a resource. It can be used to confirm that the client and
      server agree on the ordering of a resource being written.
    flagUpdate: A FlagUpdate attribute.
    labels: Optional. The labels on the resource, which can be used for
      categorization. similar to Kubernetes resource labels.
    name: Identifier. The resource name (full URI of the resource) following
      the standard naming scheme:

    provision: A Provision attribute.
    rollout: Optional. Specifies which rollout created this Unit Operation.
      This cannot be modified and is used for filtering purposes only. If a
      dependent unit and unit operation are created as part of another unit
      operation, they will use the same rolloutId.
    schedule: Optional. When to schedule this operation.
    state: Optional. Output only. UnitOperationState describes the current
      state of the unit operation.
    uid: Output only. The unique identifier of the resource. UID is unique in
      the time and space for this resource within the scope of the service. It
      is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a
      resource and must not be changed. UID is used to uniquely identify
      resources with resource name reuses. This should be a UUID4.
    unit: Required. Immutable. The Unit a given UnitOperation will act upon.
    updateTime: Output only. The timestamp when the resource was last updated.
      Any change to the resource made by users must refresh this value.
      Changes to a resource made by the service should refresh this value.
    upgrade: A Upgrade attribute.
