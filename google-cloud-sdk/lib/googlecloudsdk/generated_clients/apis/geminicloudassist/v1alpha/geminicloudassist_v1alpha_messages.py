      binding. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM
      policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).
    members: Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud
      resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A

      `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group. For
      example, `admins@example.com`. * `domain:{domain}`: The G Suite domain
      (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example,
      `google.com` or `example.com`. * `principal://iam.googleapis.com/locatio
      ns/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}`: A
      single identity in a workforce identity pool. * `principalSet://iam.goog

      record the observations that were used to generate it. An extracted
      param will record what it was extracted from. The graph of premises and
      conclusions will be acyclic within a revision.
    data: Optional. A structured representation of the observation, as chosen
      by the observer. Optional. If present, an observer SHOULD also supply a
      text description of the observation to facilitate processing by an LLM
      and rendering in the UI.
    dataUrls: Optional. A map from human-readable names to URLs for supportive
      evidence. The map key will be rendered as URL anchor text. Fill this in
      whenever an observation depends on a thing outside the system. For
      example, logging/metrics/etc query that can regenerate the observation.
    id: Required. Uniquely identifies this observation. Should depend on the
      'core content' of the observation, but not e.g. on the relevance. Should
      not depend on anything that can vary unpredictably from revision to
      revision to run. This is also the map key in the parent Investigation.
      They should be hierarchical with '.' as the separator starting with the
      name of the observer. So for instance, diagnostics.runbook.ABC, or
      signals.logs, or user.input.2 It should be usable as a URL component.
      (Case-insensitive [a-z0-9-._]+) These will not be rendered for users,
      but will be visible in the data model. They will be used by Google
      engineers to localize bugs so should be semi-readable.
    knowledgeUrls: Optional. A map from human-readable names to URLs for
      documentation.
    observationCompletionState: Optional. An ObservationCompletionState
      represents whether the emitted observation is fully formed and should be
      shown the to the user. This is intended to allow hiding observations
      that are in an intermediate state.
    observationType: Required. The type of the observation (e.g. log, metric,
      etc.)
    observedNormalOperation: Optional. Whether this observation gives us
      information about an issue / root cause (false) or indicates normal
      operation (true). This is conceptually different from the relevance and
      used differently. An irrelevant observation should be hidden from the
      LLM and also the user. A relevant observation of a problem should be
      shown as an observation and should motivate a hypothesis. A relevant
      finding of normalcy may / may not be shown in the UI, but should be used
      by the LLM to filter out hypotheses that are refuted by the finding.
    observerErrors: Output only. An error within the Investigation system that
      blocked an observer from making a particular observation. The error
      string here will be shown to users. Repeated because an observer might
      lack multiple permissions. Deprecated: Use
      ObserverStatus.observer_errors instead.
    observerType: Required. The origin of the data, e.g. user, system code,
      LLM etc.
    recommendation: Optional. Natural language [markdown] text which describes
      a recommended action to remediate / fix the root cause. This is free
      form and not machine- processed at this time. A recommendation can be: -
      High-level remediation descriptions - Specific and tactical remediation
      steps with executable commands - Specific and tactical troubleshooting
      steps for where to investigate next with executable commands
    relevanceOverride: Optional. The user's relevance judgement.
    relevantResources: Optional. The Google Cloud resources relevant to the
      observation. These should be fully qualified resource URIs, e.g.,
      "//compute.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/zones/us-
      central1-a/instances/my-instance"
    systemRelevanceScore: Optional. How relevant this observation is to the
      investigation, as inferred by the system. Optional. Should be in the
      range [-1, 1]. For OBSERVATION_TYPE_HYPOTHESIS, represents confidence in
      the explanation. Only root-cause hypotheses are ranked against each
      other. For other ObservationTypes, this represents a relevance score,
      and they are ranked against each other. A value of 0 is neutral.
    text: Optional. Natural-language [markdown] text associated with the
      observation. This is the core content, not a metadata description.
    timeIntervals: Optional. When this observation occurred. Observations
      should have at least one time range so that the observations can be
      shown on a timeline and so we can find related events. For a repeated
      but not continuous event, it is appropriate to have more than one range.
      The UI may combine these.
    timeRanges: Optional. When this observation occurred. Observations should
      have at least one time range so that the observations can be shown on a
      timeline and so we can find related events. For a repeated but not
      continuous event, it is appropriate to have more than one range. The UI
      may combine these. DEPRECATED: Use time_intervals instead.
    title: Optional. The label shown in the UI. This need not be unique within
      an investigation. However, it should be specific and less than 80
      characters so that the user can easily scan across many observations.
      "Nettools pod configured with ALL capabilities dropped" is much better
      than "Interesting pod configuration".

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).
