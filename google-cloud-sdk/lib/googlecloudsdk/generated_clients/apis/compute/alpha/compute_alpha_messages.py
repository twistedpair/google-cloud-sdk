    autoDelete: Specifies whether the disk will be auto-deleted when the
      instance is deleted (but not when the disk is detached from the
      instance).
    boot: Indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual machine will use the
      first partition of the disk for its root filesystem.
    deviceName: Specifies a unique device name of your choice that is
      reflected into the /dev/disk/by-id/google-* tree of a Linux operating
      system running within the instance. This name can be used to reference
      the device for mounting, resizing, and so on, from within the instance.
      If not specified, the server chooses a default device name to apply to
      this disk, in the form persistent-disk-x, where x is a number assigned
      by Google Compute Engine. This field is only applicable for persistent

    diskEncryptionKey: Encrypts or decrypts a disk using a customer-supplied
      encryption key. If you are creating a new disk, this field encrypts the
      new disk using an encryption key that you provide. If you are attaching
      an existing disk that is already encrypted, this field decrypts the disk
      using the customer-supplied encryption key. If you encrypt a disk using
      a customer-supplied key, you must provide the same key again when you
      attempt to use this resource at a later time. For example, you must
      provide the key when you create a snapshot or an image from the disk or
      when you attach the disk to a virtual machine instance. If you do not
      provide an encryption key, then the disk will be encrypted using an
      automatically generated key and you do not need to provide a key to use
      the disk later. Instance templates do not store customer-supplied
      encryption keys, so you cannot use your own keys to encrypt disks in a
      managed instance group.
    diskSizeGb: The size of the disk in GB.

      for the boot disk. If you have many disks attached to an instance, each
      disk would have a unique index number.
    initializeParams: [Input Only] Specifies the parameters for a new disk
      that will be created alongside the new instance. Use initialization
      parameters to create boot disks or local SSDs attached to the new
      instance. This property is mutually exclusive with the source property;
      you can only define one or the other, but not both.

      persistent disks can use NVMe. For more information, see About
      persistent disks.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#attachedDisk for
      attached disks.
    licenses: [Output Only] Any valid publicly visible licenses.
    locked: [Output Only] Whether to indicate the attached disk is locked. The
      locked disk is not allowed to be detached from the instance, or to be
      used as the source of the snapshot creation, and the image creation. The
      instance with at least one locked attached disk is not allow to be used

  Enums:
    UtilizationTargetTypeValueValuesEnum: Defines how target utilization value
      is expressed for a Stackdriver Monitoring metric. Either GAUGE,
      DELTA_PER_SECOND, or DELTA_PER_MINUTE.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter string, compatible with a Stackdriver Monitoring filter
      string for TimeSeries.list API call. This filter is used to select a
      specific TimeSeries for the purpose of autoscaling and to determine
      whether the metric is exporting per-instance or per-group data. For the
      filter to be valid for autoscaling purposes, the following rules apply:
      - You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors. - You can
      only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without any functions
      for each selector. - You can specify the metric in both the filter
      string and in the metric field. However, if specified in both places,
      the metric must be identical. - The monitored resource type determines
      what kind of values are expected for the metric. If it is a
      gce_instance, the autoscaler expects the metric to include a separate
      TimeSeries for each instance in a group. In such a case, you cannot
      filter on resource labels. If the resource type is any other value, the
      autoscaler expects this metric to contain values that apply to the
      entire autoscaled instance group and resource label filtering can be
      performed to point autoscaler at the correct TimeSeries to scale upon.
      This is called a *per-group metric* for the purpose of autoscaling. If
      not specified, the type defaults to gce_instance. Try to provide a
      filter that is selective enough to pick just one TimeSeries for the
      autoscaled group or for each of the instances (if you are using
      gce_instance resource type). If multiple TimeSeries are returned upon
      the query execution, the autoscaler will sum their respective values to
      obtain its scaling value.
    metric: The identifier (type) of the Stackdriver Monitoring metric. The
      metric cannot have negative values. The metric must have a value type of
      INT64 or DOUBLE.
    singleInstanceAssignment: If scaling is based on a per-group metric value
      that represents the total amount of work to be done or resource usage,
      set this value to an amount assigned for a single instance of the scaled
      group. Autoscaler keeps the number of instances proportional to the
      value of this metric. The metric itself does not change value due to
      group resizing. A good metric to use with the target is for example
      pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages or a custom
      metric exporting the total number of requests coming to your instances.
      A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or median latency,
      since this value can't include a chunk assignable to a single instance,
      it could be better used with utilization_target instead.
    utilizationTarget: The target value of the metric that autoscaler
      maintains. This must be a positive value. A utilization metric scales
      number of virtual machines handling requests to increase or decrease
      proportionally to the metric. For example, a good metric to use as a
      utilization_target is https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/instance/net
      work/received_bytes_count. The autoscaler works to keep this value
      constant for each of the instances.

  r"""Message containing Cloud CDN configuration for a backend bucket.

  Enums:
    CacheModeValueValuesEnum: Specifies the cache setting for all responses
      from this backend. The possible values are: USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS Requires
      the origin to set valid caching headers to cache content. Responses
      without these headers will not be cached at Google's edge, and will
      require a full trip to the origin on every request, potentially
      impacting performance and increasing load on the origin server.
      FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all content, ignoring any "private", "no-store" or
      "no-cache" directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this
      may result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable)
      content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including
      common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets
      (JavaScript and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as
      uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML), will not be
      cached.

  Fields:
    bypassCacheOnRequestHeaders: Bypass the cache when the specified request
      headers are matched - e.g. Pragma or Authorization headers. Up to 5
      headers can be specified. The cache is bypassed for all
      cdnPolicy.cacheMode settings.
    cacheKeyPolicy: The CacheKeyPolicy for this CdnPolicy.
    cacheMode: Specifies the cache setting for all responses from this
      backend. The possible values are: USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS Requires the origin
      to set valid caching headers to cache content. Responses without these
      headers will not be cached at Google's edge, and will require a full
      trip to the origin on every request, potentially impacting performance
      and increasing load on the origin server. FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all
      content, ignoring any "private", "no-store" or "no-cache" directives in
      Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN
      caching private, per-user (user identifiable) content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC
      Automatically cache static content, including common image formats,
      media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and CSS). Requests
      and responses that are marked as uncacheable, as well as dynamic content
      (including HTML), will not be cached.
    clientTtl: Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) maximum TTL.
      This is used to clamp the max-age (or Expires) value sent to the client.
      With FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of client_ttl and default_ttl is used
      for the response max-age directive, along with a "public" directive. For
      cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-
      age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max-age
      directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also
      ensures a "public" cache-control directive is present. If a client TTL
      is not specified, a default value (1 hour) will be used. The maximum
      allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year).
    defaultTtl: Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this
      origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or
      s-max-age). Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate". The value of
      defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL, but can
      be equal. When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL
      will overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed value
      is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may
      be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    maxTtl: Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by
      this origin. Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage
      higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL seconds in the
      future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of
      an s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent to the client will not
      be modified. Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate". The maximum
      allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed
      objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    negativeCaching: Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set,
      in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects.
      This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience
      by reducing response latency. When the cache mode is set to
      CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to
      responses with the specified response code that lack any Cache-Control,
      Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When the cache mode is set to
      FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to all responses with the
      specified response code, and override any caching headers. By default,
      Cloud CDN will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes:
      HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404
      (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP
      405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not
      Implemented): 60s. These defaults can be overridden in
      negative_caching_policy.
    negativeCachingPolicy: Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status
      code. negative_caching must be enabled to configure
      negative_caching_policy. Omitting the policy and leaving
      negative_caching enabled will use Cloud CDN's default cache TTLs. Note
      that when specifying an explicit negative_caching_policy, you should
      take care to specify a cache TTL for all response codes that you wish to
      cache. Cloud CDN will not apply any default negative caching when a
      policy exists.
    requestCoalescing: If true then Cloud CDN will combine multiple concurrent
      cache fill requests into a small number of requests to the origin.
    serveWhileStale: Serve existing content from the cache (if available) when
      revalidating content with the origin, or when an error is encountered
      when refreshing the cache. This setting defines the default "max-stale"
      duration for any cached responses that do not specify a max-stale
      directive. Stale responses that exceed the TTL configured here will not
      be served. The default limit (max-stale) is 86400s (1 day), which will
      allow stale content to be served up to this limit beyond the max-age (or
      s-max-age) of a cached response. The maximum allowed value is 604800 (1
      week). Set this to zero (0) to disable serve-while-stale.
    signedUrlCacheMaxAgeSec: Maximum number of seconds the response to a
      signed URL request will be considered fresh. After this time period, the
      response will be revalidated before being served. Defaults to 1hr
      (3600s). When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will
      internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a
      "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any
      existing Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in responses
      will not be altered.

      proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to true. For more details,
      see: [Session Affinity](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/backend-service#session_affinity).
    VpcNetworkScopeValueValuesEnum: The network scope of the backends that can
      be added to the backend service. This field can be either
      GLOBAL_VPC_NETWORK or REGIONAL_VPC_NETWORK. A backend service with the
      VPC scope set to GLOBAL_VPC_NETWORK is only allowed to have backends in
      global VPC networks. When the VPC scope is set to REGIONAL_VPC_NETWORK
      the backend service is only allowed to have backends in regional
      networks in the same scope as the backend service. Note: if not
      specified then GLOBAL_VPC_NETWORK will be used.

  Fields:
    affinityCookieTtlSec: Lifetime of cookies in seconds. This setting is
      applicable to external and internal HTTP(S) load balancers and Traffic
      Director and requires GENERATED_COOKIE or HTTP_COOKIE session affinity.
      If set to 0, the cookie is non-persistent and lasts only until the end
      of the browser session (or equivalent). The maximum allowed value is two
      weeks (1,209,600). Not supported when the backend service is referenced
      by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has
      validateForProxyless field set to true.
    backends: The list of backends that serve this BackendService.
    cdnPolicy: Cloud CDN configuration for this BackendService. Only available
      for specified load balancer types.
    circuitBreakers: A CircuitBreakers attribute.
    compressionMode: Compress text responses using Brotli or gzip compression,
      based on the client's Accept-Encoding header.
    connectionDraining: A ConnectionDraining attribute.
    connectionTrackingPolicy: Connection Tracking configuration for this
      BackendService. Connection tracking policy settings are only available
      for Network Load Balancing and Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing.
    consistentHash: Consistent Hash-based load balancing can be used to
      provide soft session affinity based on HTTP headers, cookies or other
      properties. This load balancing policy is applicable only for HTTP
      connections. The affinity to a particular destination host will be lost
      when one or more hosts are added/removed from the destination service.
      This field specifies parameters that control consistent hashing. This
      field is only applicable when localityLbPolicy is set to MAGLEV or
      RING_HASH. This field is applicable to either: - A regional backend
      service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and
      load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED. - A global backend
      service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    customRequestHeaders: Headers that the load balancer adds to proxied
      requests. See [Creating custom headers](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/custom-headers).
    customResponseHeaders: Headers that the load balancer adds to proxied
      responses. See [Creating custom headers](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/custom-headers).
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    edgeSecurityPolicy: [Output Only] The resource URL for the edge security
      policy associated with this backend service.
    enableCDN: If true, enables Cloud CDN for the backend service of an
      external HTTP(S) load balancer.
    failoverPolicy: Requires at least one backend instance group to be defined
      as a backup (failover) backend. For load balancers that have
      configurable failover: [Internal TCP/UDP Load
      Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/internal/failover-overview) and [external TCP/UDP Load
      Balancing](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/network/networklb-failover-overview).
    fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored
      in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field
      will be ignored when inserting a BackendService. An up-to-date
      fingerprint must be provided in order to update the BackendService,
      otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see
      the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a
      BackendService.
    healthChecks: The list of URLs to the healthChecks, httpHealthChecks
      (legacy), or httpsHealthChecks (legacy) resource for health checking
      this backend service. Not all backend services support legacy health
      checks. See Load balancer guide. Currently, at most one health check can
      be specified for each backend service. Backend services with instance
      group or zonal NEG backends must have a health check. Backend services
      with internet or serverless NEG backends must not have a health check.
    iap: The configurations for Identity-Aware Proxy on this resource. Not
      available for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load
      Balancing.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#backendService for
      backend services.
    loadBalancingScheme: Specifies the load balancer type. A backend service
      created for one type of load balancer cannot be used with another. For
      more information, refer to Choosing a load balancer.
    localityLbPolicies: A list of locality load balancing policies to be used
      in order of preference. Either the policy or the customPolicy field
      should be set. Overrides any value set in the localityLbPolicy field.
      localityLbPolicies is only supported when the BackendService is
      referenced by a URL Map that is referenced by a target gRPC proxy that
      has the validateForProxyless field set to true.
    localityLbPolicy: The load balancing algorithm used within the scope of
      the locality. The possible values are: - ROUND_ROBIN: This is a simple
      policy in which each healthy backend is selected in round robin order.
      This is the default. - LEAST_REQUEST: An O(1) algorithm which selects
      two random healthy hosts and picks the host which has fewer active
      requests. - RING_HASH: The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements
      consistent hashing to backends. The algorithm has the property that the
      addition/removal of a host from a set of N hosts only affects 1/N of the
      requests. - RANDOM: The load balancer selects a random healthy host. -
      ORIGINAL_DESTINATION: Backend host is selected based on the client
      connection metadata, i.e., connections are opened to the same address as
      the destination address of the incoming connection before the connection
      was redirected to the load balancer. - MAGLEV: used as a drop in
      replacement for the ring hash load balancer. Maglev is not as stable as
      ring hash but has faster table lookup build times and host selection
      times. For more information about Maglev, see
      https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub44824 This field is applicable to
      either: - A regional backend service with the service_protocol set to
      HTTP, HTTPS, or HTTP2, and load_balancing_scheme set to
      INTERNAL_MANAGED. - A global backend service with the
      load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. If sessionAffinity
      is not NONE, and this field is not set to MAGLEV or RING_HASH, session
      affinity settings will not take effect. Only ROUND_ROBIN and RING_HASH
      are supported when the backend service is referenced by a URL map that
      is bound to target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field set to
      true.
    logConfig: This field denotes the logging options for the load balancer
      traffic served by this backend service. If logging is enabled, logs will
      be exported to Stackdriver.
    maxStreamDuration: Specifies the default maximum duration (timeout) for
      streams to this service. Duration is computed from the beginning of the
      stream until the response has been completely processed, including all
      retries. A stream that does not complete in this duration is closed. If
      not specified, there will be no timeout limit, i.e. the maximum duration
      is infinite. This value can be overridden in the PathMatcher
      configuration of the UrlMap that references this backend service. This
      field is only allowed when the loadBalancingScheme of the backend
      service is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    network: The URL of the network to which this backend service belongs.
      This field can only be specified when the load balancing scheme is set
      to INTERNAL.
    outlierDetection: Settings controlling the eviction of unhealthy hosts
      from the load balancing pool for the backend service. If not set, this
      feature is considered disabled. This field is applicable to either: - A
      regional backend service with the service_protocol set to HTTP, HTTPS,
      HTTP2, or GRPC, and load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_MANAGED. - A
      global backend service with the load_balancing_scheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    port: Deprecated in favor of portName. The TCP port to connect on the
      backend. The default value is 80. For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing
      and Network Load Balancing, omit port.
    portName: A named port on a backend instance group representing the port
      for communication to the backend VMs in that group. The named port must
      be [defined on each backend instance
      group](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-
      service#named_ports). This parameter has no meaning if the backends are
      NEGs. For Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Network Load Balancing,
      omit port_name.
    protocol: The protocol this BackendService uses to communicate with
      backends. Possible values are HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP2, TCP, SSL, UDP or GRPC.
      depending on the chosen load balancer or Traffic Director configuration.
      Refer to the documentation for the load balancers or for Traffic
      Director for more information. Must be set to GRPC when the backend
      service is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional backend service
      resides. This field is not applicable to global backend services. You
      must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not
      settable as a field in the request body.
    securityPolicy: [Output Only] The resource URL for the security policy
      associated with this backend service.
    securitySettings: This field specifies the security settings that apply to
      this backend service. This field is applicable to a global backend
      service with the load_balancing_scheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    selfLinkWithId: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource with
      the resource id.
    serviceBindings: URLs of networkservices.ServiceBinding resources. Can
      only be set if load balancing scheme is INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. If set,
      lists of backends and health checks must be both empty.
    serviceLbPolicy: URL to networkservices.ServiceLbPolicy resource. Can only
      be set if load balancing scheme is EXTERNAL, INTERNAL_MANAGED or
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. If used with a backend service, must reference a
      global policy. If used with a regional backend service, must reference a
      regional policy.
    sessionAffinity: Type of session affinity to use. The default is NONE.
      Only NONE and HEADER_FIELD are supported when the backend service is
      referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has
      validateForProxyless field set to true. For more details, see: [Session
      Affinity](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-
      service#session_affinity).
    subsetting: A Subsetting attribute.
    timeoutSec: The backend service timeout has a different meaning depending
      on the type of load balancer. For more information see, Backend service
      settings. The default is 30 seconds. The full range of timeout values
      allowed goes from 1 through 2,147,483,647 seconds. This value can be
      overridden in the PathMatcher configuration of the UrlMap that
      references this backend service. Not supported when the backend service
      is referenced by a URL map that is bound to target gRPC proxy that has
      validateForProxyless field set to true. Instead, use maxStreamDuration.
    vpcNetworkScope: The network scope of the backends that can be added to
      the backend service. This field can be either GLOBAL_VPC_NETWORK or
      REGIONAL_VPC_NETWORK. A backend service with the VPC scope set to
      GLOBAL_VPC_NETWORK is only allowed to have backends in global VPC
      networks. When the VPC scope is set to REGIONAL_VPC_NETWORK the backend
      service is only allowed to have backends in regional networks in the
      same scope as the backend service. Note: if not specified then
      GLOBAL_VPC_NETWORK will be used.

  r"""Message containing Cloud CDN configuration for a backend service.

  Enums:
    CacheModeValueValuesEnum: Specifies the cache setting for all responses
      from this backend. The possible values are: USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS Requires
      the origin to set valid caching headers to cache content. Responses
      without these headers will not be cached at Google's edge, and will
      require a full trip to the origin on every request, potentially
      impacting performance and increasing load on the origin server.
      FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all content, ignoring any "private", "no-store" or
      "no-cache" directives in Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this
      may result in Cloud CDN caching private, per-user (user identifiable)
      content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC Automatically cache static content, including
      common image formats, media (video and audio), and web assets
      (JavaScript and CSS). Requests and responses that are marked as
      uncacheable, as well as dynamic content (including HTML), will not be
      cached.

  Fields:
    bypassCacheOnRequestHeaders: Bypass the cache when the specified request
      headers are matched - e.g. Pragma or Authorization headers. Up to 5
      headers can be specified. The cache is bypassed for all
      cdnPolicy.cacheMode settings.
    cacheKeyPolicy: The CacheKeyPolicy for this CdnPolicy.
    cacheMode: Specifies the cache setting for all responses from this
      backend. The possible values are: USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS Requires the origin
      to set valid caching headers to cache content. Responses without these
      headers will not be cached at Google's edge, and will require a full
      trip to the origin on every request, potentially impacting performance
      and increasing load on the origin server. FORCE_CACHE_ALL Cache all
      content, ignoring any "private", "no-store" or "no-cache" directives in
      Cache-Control response headers. Warning: this may result in Cloud CDN
      caching private, per-user (user identifiable) content. CACHE_ALL_STATIC
      Automatically cache static content, including common image formats,
      media (video and audio), and web assets (JavaScript and CSS). Requests
      and responses that are marked as uncacheable, as well as dynamic content
      (including HTML), will not be cached.
    clientTtl: Specifies a separate client (e.g. browser client) maximum TTL.
      This is used to clamp the max-age (or Expires) value sent to the client.
      With FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the lesser of client_ttl and default_ttl is used
      for the response max-age directive, along with a "public" directive. For
      cacheable content in CACHE_ALL_STATIC mode, client_ttl clamps the max-
      age from the origin (if specified), or else sets the response max-age
      directive to the lesser of the client_ttl and default_ttl, and also
      ensures a "public" cache-control directive is present. If a client TTL
      is not specified, a default value (1 hour) will be used. The maximum
      allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year).
    defaultTtl: Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this
      origin for responses that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or
      s-max-age). Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate". The value of
      defaultTTL cannot be set to a value greater than that of maxTTL, but can
      be equal. When the cacheMode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, the defaultTTL
      will overwrite the TTL set in all responses. The maximum allowed value
      is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed objects may
      be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    maxTtl: Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by
      this origin. Cache directives that attempt to set a max-age or s-maxage
      higher than this, or an Expires header more than maxTTL seconds in the
      future will be capped at the value of maxTTL, as if it were the value of
      an s-maxage Cache-Control directive. Headers sent to the client will not
      be modified. Setting a TTL of "0" means "always revalidate". The maximum
      allowed value is 31,622,400s (1 year), noting that infrequently accessed
      objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.
    negativeCaching: Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set,
      in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects.
      This can reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience
      by reducing response latency. When the cache mode is set to
      CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to
      responses with the specified response code that lack any Cache-Control,
      Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When the cache mode is set to
      FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to all responses with the
      specified response code, and override any caching headers. By default,
      Cloud CDN will apply the following default TTLs to these status codes:
      HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301, 308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404
      (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP
      405 (Method Not Found), 421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not
      Implemented): 60s. These defaults can be overridden in
      negative_caching_policy.
    negativeCachingPolicy: Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status
      code. negative_caching must be enabled to configure
      negative_caching_policy. Omitting the policy and leaving
      negative_caching enabled will use Cloud CDN's default cache TTLs. Note
      that when specifying an explicit negative_caching_policy, you should
      take care to specify a cache TTL for all response codes that you wish to
      cache. Cloud CDN will not apply any default negative caching when a
      policy exists.
    requestCoalescing: If true then Cloud CDN will combine multiple concurrent
      cache fill requests into a small number of requests to the origin.
    serveWhileStale: Serve existing content from the cache (if available) when
      revalidating content with the origin, or when an error is encountered
      when refreshing the cache. This setting defines the default "max-stale"
      duration for any cached responses that do not specify a max-stale
      directive. Stale responses that exceed the TTL configured here will not
      be served. The default limit (max-stale) is 86400s (1 day), which will
      allow stale content to be served up to this limit beyond the max-age (or
      s-max-age) of a cached response. The maximum allowed value is 604800 (1
      week). Set this to zero (0) to disable serve-while-stale.
    signedUrlCacheMaxAgeSec: Maximum number of seconds the response to a
      signed URL request will be considered fresh. After this time period, the
      response will be revalidated before being served. Defaults to 1hr
      (3600s). When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will
      internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a
      "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any
      existing Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in responses
      will not be altered.

      and zone have names that match the name pattern then the generated
      instance numbers start after the biggest existing number. For example,
      if there exists an instance with name inst-0050, then instance names
      generated using the pattern inst-#### begin with inst-0051. The name
      pattern placeholder #...# can contain up to 18 characters.
    perInstanceProperties: Per-instance properties to be set on individual

      instanceProperties to override specific values from an existing instance
      template. Bulk API follows the semantics of JSON Merge Patch described

      are all valid URLs to an instance template: -

      /global/instanceTemplates/instanceTemplate -
      projects/project/global/instanceTemplates/instanceTemplate -

class ComputeAcceleratorTypesAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeAcceleratorTypesAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on

    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest

class ComputeAutoscalersListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeAutoscalersListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

class ComputeBackendServicesListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeBackendServicesListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable

class ComputeDisksAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeDisksAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

class ComputeExternalVpnGatewaysListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeExternalVpnGatewaysListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

  Fields:

      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow

      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`

      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page

      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

  r"""A ComputeFutureReservationsListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions

      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The

      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne

    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be

      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used

      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions

      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =

      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq

      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.

class ComputeHttpHealthChecksListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeHttpHealthChecksListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

class ComputeImagesListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeImagesListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

class ComputeInstanceGroupManagersListErrorsRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeInstanceGroupManagersListErrorsRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    instanceGroupManager: The name of the managed instance group. It must be a
      string that meets the requirements in RFC1035, or an unsigned long
      integer: must match regexp pattern:
      (?:[a-z](?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?)|1-9{0,19}.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

class ComputeInstanceGroupsAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeInstanceGroupsAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

class ComputeInstanceGroupsListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeInstanceGroupsListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can

class ComputeInstancesListReferrersRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeInstancesListReferrersRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    instance: Name of the target instance scoping this request, or '-' if the
      request should span over all instances in the container.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

class ComputeInstantSnapshotsAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeInstantSnapshotsAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`

class ComputeInterconnectsListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeInterconnectsListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the

class ComputeNetworkEndpointGroupsAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeNetworkEndpointGroupsAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

class ComputeNetworkFirewallPoliciesListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeNetworkFirewallPoliciesListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.

  Fields:
    direction: The direction of the exchanged routes.
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use

  r"""A ComputeNodeGroupsListNodesRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    nodeGroup: Name of the NodeGroup resource whose nodes you want to list.
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

class ComputeNodeTypesAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeNodeTypesAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the

class ComputePacketMirroringsAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputePacketMirroringsAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest

      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.

class ComputePublicAdvertisedPrefixesListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputePublicAdvertisedPrefixesListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than

class ComputeRegionCommitmentsAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeRegionCommitmentsAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

class ComputeRegionDisksListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeRegionDisksListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    region: Name of the region for this request.

class ComputeRegionHealthCheckServicesListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeRegionHealthCheckServicesListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    region: Name of the region scoping this request.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

  r"""A ComputeRegionInstanceGroupManagersListErrorsRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    instanceGroupManager: The name of the managed instance group. It must be a
      string that meets the requirements in RFC1035, or an unsigned long
      integer: must match regexp pattern:
      (?:[a-z](?:[-a-z0-9]{0,61}[a-z0-9])?)|1-9{0,19}.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.
    region: Name of the region scoping this request. This should conform to
      RFC1035.
    returnPartialSuccess: Opt-in for partial success behavior which provides
      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

class ComputeRegionInstanceGroupsListInstancesRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeRegionInstanceGroupsListInstancesRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    instanceGroup: Name of the regional instance group for which we want to
      list the instances.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.

class ComputeRegionNetworkFirewallPoliciesListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeRegionNetworkFirewallPoliciesListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

      partial results in case of failure. The default value is false.

      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.

      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that

      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`

      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`

class ComputeRegionSslPoliciesListAvailableFeaturesRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeRegionSslPoliciesListAvailableFeaturesRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.

class ComputeResourcePoliciesListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeResourcePoliciesListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Project ID for this request.

    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new

class ComputeRoutesListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeRoutesListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page

    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope

      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.
    project: Name of the project scoping this request.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page

      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.

class ComputeTargetInstancesAggregatedListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeTargetInstancesAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on

      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.

  r"""A ComputeTargetPoolsListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope
      type in response. For resource types which predate this field, if this
      flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the
      resource type is expected to be found will be included.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.

      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq

  r"""A ComputeUrlMapsAggregatedListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)

      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne

    includeAllScopes: Indicates whether every visible scope for each scope
      type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. For new
      resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new
      resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne

    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are

class ComputeZoneQueuedResourcesListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A ComputeZoneQueuedResourcesListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
      Most Compute resources support two types of filter expressions:
      expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow
      API improvement proposal AIP-160. If you want to use AIP-160, your
      expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that
      you want to use for filtering. The value must be a string, a number, or
      a boolean. The operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`
      or `:`. For example, if you are filtering Compute Engine instances, you
      can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name !=
      example-instance`. The `:` operator can be used with string fields to
      match substrings. For non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=`
      operator. The `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been
      defined. For example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ```
      labels.owner:* ``` You can also filter nested fields. For example, you
      could specify `scheduling.automaticRestart = false` to include instances
      only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. You can use
      filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. To filter
      on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within
      parentheses. For example: ``` (scheduling.automaticRestart = true)
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") ``` By default, each expression is an
      `AND` expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (cpuPlatform = "Intel Skylake") OR
      (cpuPlatform = "Intel Broadwell") AND (scheduling.automaticRestart =
      true) ``` If you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal)
      or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized
      expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized
      expressions. Examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq
      'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"`
      `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` The literal value is
      interpreted as a regular expression using Google RE2 library syntax. The
      literal value must match the entire field. For example, to filter for
      instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne
      .*instance`.
    maxResults: The maximum number of results per page that should be
      returned. If the number of available results is larger than
      `maxResults`, Compute Engine returns a `nextPageToken` that can be used
      to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. Acceptable
      values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (Default: `500`)
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, results are
      returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. You can
      also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp
      using `orderBy="creationTimestamp desc"`. This sorts results based on
      the `creationTimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest
      result first). Use this to sort resources like operations so that the
      newest operation is returned first. Currently, only sorting by `name` or
      `creationTimestamp desc` is supported.
    pageToken: Specifies a page token to use. Set `pageToken` to the
      `nextPageToken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page
      of results.

    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    diskEncryptionKey: Encrypts the disk using a customer-supplied encryption
      key or a customer-managed encryption key. Encryption keys do not protect
      access to metadata of the disk. After you encrypt a disk with a
      customer-supplied key, you must provide the same key if you use the disk
      later. For example, to create a disk snapshot, to create a disk image,
      to create a machine image, or to attach the disk to a virtual machine.
      After you encrypt a disk with a customer-managed key, the
      diskEncryptionKey.kmsKeyName is set to a key *version* name once the
      disk is created. The disk is encrypted with this version of the key. In
      the response, diskEncryptionKey.kmsKeyName appears in the following
      format: "diskEncryptionKey.kmsKeyName":
      "projects/kms_project_id/locations/region/keyRings/
      key_region/cryptoKeys/key /cryptoKeysVersions/version If you do not
      provide an encryption key when creating the disk, then the disk is
      encrypted using an automatically generated key and you don't need to
      provide a key to use the disk later.
    eraseWindowsVssSignature: Specifies whether the disk restored from a
      source snapshot should erase Windows specific VSS signature.
    guestOsFeatures: A list of features to enable on the guest operating
      system. Applicable only for bootable images. Read Enabling guest

    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#disk for disks.
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this disk,
      which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for optimistic
      locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and
      changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always
      provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change
      labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet.
      To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a disk.
    labels: Labels to apply to this disk. These can be later modified by the
      setLabels method.

      public API.
    locked: [Output Only] The field indicates if the disk is created from a
      locked source image. Attachment of a disk created from a locked source
      image will cause the following operations to become irreversibly
      prohibited: - R/W or R/O disk attachment to any other instance - Disk
      detachment. And the disk can only be deleted when the instance is
      deleted - Creation of images or snapshots - Disk cloning Furthermore,
      the instance with at least one disk with locked flag set to true will be
      prohibited from performing the operations below: - Further attachment of
      secondary disks. - Detachment of any disks - Create machine images -
      Create instance template - Delete the instance with --keep-disk
      parameter set to true for locked disks - Attach a locked disk with
      --auto-delete parameter set to false
    multiWriter: Indicates whether or not the disk can be read/write attached
      to more than one instance.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the

      bytes. If not present in a request, a default value is used. The
      currently supported size is 4096, other sizes may be added in the
      future. If an unsupported value is requested, the error message will
      list the supported values for the caller's project.
    provisionedIops: Indicates how many IOPS to provision for the disk. This
      sets the number of I/O operations per second that the disk can handle.
      Values must be between 10,000 and 120,000. For more details, see the
      Extreme persistent disk documentation.
    provisionedThroughput: Indicates how much throughput to provision for the
      disk. This sets the number of throughput mb per second that the disk can
      handle. Values must be between 1 and 7,124.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the disk resides. Only

      persistent disk. If you specify this field along with a source, the
      value of sizeGb must not be less than the size of the source. Acceptable
      values are 1 to 65536, inclusive.
    sourceConsistencyGroupPolicy: [Output Only] URL of the
      DiskConsistencyGroupPolicy for a secondary disk that was created using a
      consistency group.
    sourceConsistencyGroupPolicyId: [Output Only] ID of the
      DiskConsistencyGroupPolicy for a secondary disk that was created using a
      consistency group.

      image is deleted, this field will not be set. To create a disk with one
      of the public operating system images, specify the image by its family
      name. For example, specify family/debian-9 to use the latest Debian 9
      image: projects/debian-cloud/global/images/family/debian-9
      Alternatively, use a specific version of a public operating system
      image: projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-9-stretch-vYYYYMMDD To
      create a disk with a custom image that you created, specify the image
      name in the following format: global/images/my-custom-image You can also
      specify a custom image by its image family, which returns the latest
      version of the image in that family. Replace the image name with
      family/family-name: global/images/family/my-image-family
    sourceImageEncryptionKey: The customer-supplied encryption key of the
      source image. Required if the source image is protected by a customer-
      supplied encryption key.
    sourceImageId: [Output Only] The ID value of the image used to create this
      disk. This value identifies the exact image that was used to create this
      persistent disk. For example, if you created the persistent disk from an

      source image ID would identify the exact version of the image that was
      used.
    sourceInstantSnapshot: The source instant snapshot used to create this
      disk. You can provide this as a partial or full URL to the resource. For
      example, the following are valid values: -

      projects/project/zones/zone/instantSnapshots/instantSnapshot -
      zones/zone/instantSnapshots/instantSnapshot
    sourceInstantSnapshotId: [Output Only] The unique ID of the instant
      snapshot used to create this disk. This value identifies the exact
      instant snapshot that was used to create this persistent disk. For
      example, if you created the persistent disk from an instant snapshot
      that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source
      instant snapshot ID would identify the exact version of the instant
      snapshot that was used.
    sourceSnapshot: The source snapshot used to create this disk. You can
      provide this as a partial or full URL to the resource. For example, the
      following are valid values: -
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project
      /global/snapshots/snapshot - projects/project/global/snapshots/snapshot
      - global/snapshots/snapshot

      source snapshot. Required if the source snapshot is protected by a
      customer-supplied encryption key.
    sourceSnapshotId: [Output Only] The unique ID of the snapshot used to
      create this disk. This value identifies the exact snapshot that was used
      to create this persistent disk. For example, if you created the
      persistent disk from a snapshot that was later deleted and recreated
      under the same name, the source snapshot ID would identify the exact
      version of the snapshot that was used.
    sourceStorageObject: The full Google Cloud Storage URI where the disk
      image is stored. This file must be a gzip-compressed tarball whose name
      ends in .tar.gz or virtual machine disk whose name ends in vmdk. Valid
      URIs may start with gs:// or https://storage.googleapis.com/. This flag
      is not optimized for creating multiple disks from a source storage
      object. To create many disks from a source storage object, use gcloud
      compute images import instead.
    status: [Output Only] The status of disk creation. - CREATING: Disk is
      provisioning. - RESTORING: Source data is being copied into the disk. -
      FAILED: Disk creation failed. - READY: Disk is ready for use. -

  ingress traffic to, and egress traffic from your instances. For more
  information, read Firewall rules.

  Enums:
    DirectionValueValuesEnum: Direction of traffic to which this firewall
      applies, either `INGRESS` or `EGRESS`. The default is `INGRESS`. For
      `EGRESS` traffic, you cannot specify the sourceTags fields.

  Messages:
    AllowedValueListEntry: A AllowedValueListEntry object.
    DeniedValueListEntry: A DeniedValueListEntry object.

  Fields:
    allowed: The list of ALLOW rules specified by this firewall. Each rule
      specifies a protocol and port-range tuple that describes a permitted
      connection.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    denied: The list of DENY rules specified by this firewall. Each rule
      specifies a protocol and port-range tuple that describes a denied
      connection.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this field
      when you create the resource.
    destinationRanges: If destination ranges are specified, the firewall rule
      applies only to traffic that has destination IP address in these ranges.
      These ranges must be expressed in CIDR format. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are
      supported.
    direction: Direction of traffic to which this firewall applies, either
      `INGRESS` or `EGRESS`. The default is `INGRESS`. For `EGRESS` traffic,
      you cannot specify the sourceTags fields.
    disabled: Denotes whether the firewall rule is disabled. When set to true,
      the firewall rule is not enforced and the network behaves as if it did
      not exist. If this is unspecified, the firewall rule will be enabled.
    enableLogging: Deprecated in favor of enable in LogConfig. This field
      denotes whether to enable logging for a particular firewall rule. If
      logging is enabled, logs will be exported t Cloud Logging.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#firewall for
      firewall rules.
    logConfig: This field denotes the logging options for a particular
      firewall rule. If logging is enabled, logs will be exported to Cloud
      Logging.
    name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`. The first character
      must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters (except for the
      last character) must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit. The last
      character must be a lowercase letter or digit.
    network: URL of the network resource for this firewall rule. If not
      specified when creating a firewall rule, the default network is used:
      global/networks/default If you choose to specify this field, you can
      specify the network as a full or partial URL. For example, the following
      are all valid URLs: - https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myp
      roject/global/networks/my-network -
      projects/myproject/global/networks/my-network - global/networks/default
    priority: Priority for this rule. This is an integer between `0` and
      `65535`, both inclusive. The default value is `1000`. Relative
      priorities determine which rule takes effect if multiple rules apply.
      Lower values indicate higher priority. For example, a rule with priority
      `0` has higher precedence than a rule with priority `1`. DENY rules take
      precedence over ALLOW rules if they have equal priority. Note that VPC
      networks have implied rules with a priority of `65535`. To avoid
      conflicts with the implied rules, use a priority number less than
      `65535`.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    selfLinkWithId: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource with
      the resource id.
    sourceRanges: If source ranges are specified, the firewall rule applies
      only to traffic that has a source IP address in these ranges. These
      ranges must be expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and
      sourceTags may be set. If both fields are set, the rule applies to
      traffic that has a source IP address within sourceRanges OR a source IP
      from a resource with a matching tag listed in the sourceTags field. The
      connection does not need to match both fields for the rule to apply.
      Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.
    sourceServiceAccounts: If source service accounts are specified, the
      firewall rules apply only to traffic originating from an instance with a
      service account in this list. Source service accounts cannot be used to
      control traffic to an instance's external IP address because service
      accounts are associated with an instance, not an IP address.
      sourceRanges can be set at the same time as sourceServiceAccounts. If
      both are set, the firewall applies to traffic that has a source IP
      address within the sourceRanges OR a source IP that belongs to an
      instance with service account listed in sourceServiceAccount. The
      connection does not need to match both fields for the firewall to apply.
      sourceServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as sourceTags or
      targetTags.
    sourceTags: If source tags are specified, the firewall rule applies only
      to traffic with source IPs that match the primary network interfaces of
      VM instances that have the tag and are in the same VPC network. Source
      tags cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP
      address, it only applies to traffic between instances in the same
      virtual network. Because tags are associated with instances, not IP
      addresses. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If
      both fields are set, the firewall applies to traffic that has a source
      IP address within sourceRanges OR a source IP from a resource with a
      matching tag listed in the sourceTags field. The connection does not
      need to match both fields for the firewall to apply.
    targetServiceAccounts: A list of service accounts indicating sets of
      instances located in the network that may make network connections as
      specified in allowed[]. targetServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same
      time as targetTags or sourceTags. If neither targetServiceAccounts nor
      targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on
      the specified network.
    targetTags: A list of tags that controls which instances the firewall rule
      applies to. If targetTags are specified, then the firewall rule applies
      only to instances in the VPC network that have one of those tags. If no
      targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances on
      the specified network.

  Fields:
    IPAddress: IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When
      a client sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs
      the traffic to the referenced target or backendService. While creating a
      forwarding rule, specifying an IPAddress is required under the following
      circumstances: - When the target is set to targetGrpcProxy and
      validateForProxyless is set to true, the IPAddress should be set to
      0.0.0.0. - When the target is a Private Service Connect Google APIs
      bundle, you must specify an IPAddress. Otherwise, you can optionally
      specify an IP address that references an existing static (reserved) IP
      address resource. When omitted, Google Cloud assigns an ephemeral IP
      address. Use one of the following formats to specify an IP address while
      creating a forwarding rule: * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3` *
      IPv6 address range, as in `2600:1234::/96` * Full resource URL, as in
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/
      project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name * Partial URL or by

      - regions/region/addresses/address-name - global/addresses/address-name
      - address-name The forwarding rule's target or backendService, and in
      most cases, also the loadBalancingScheme, determine the type of IP
      address that you can use. For detailed information, see [IP address
      specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-

      or SCTP. - By internal TCP/UDP load balancers, backend service-based
      network load balancers, and internal and external protocol forwarding.

    fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored
      in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field
      will be ignored when inserting a ForwardingRule. Include the fingerprint
      in patch request to ensure that you do not overwrite changes that were
      applied from another concurrent request. To see the latest fingerprint,
      make a get() request to retrieve a ForwardingRule.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    ipVersion: The IP Version that will be used by this forwarding rule. Valid
      options are IPV4 or IPV6.
    isMirroringCollector: Indicates whether or not this load balancer can be
      used as a collector for packet mirroring. To prevent mirroring loops,
      instances behind this load balancer will not have their traffic mirrored
      even if a PacketMirroring rule applies to them. This can only be set to
      true for load balancers that have their loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#forwardingRule
      for Forwarding Rule resources.
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this
      resource, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for
      optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute
      Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You
      must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or
      change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412
      conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to
      retrieve a ForwardingRule.
    labels: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified by
      the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.
    loadBalancingScheme: Specifies the forwarding rule type. For more
      information about forwarding rules, refer to Forwarding rule concepts.
    metadataFilters: Opaque filter criteria used by load balancer to restrict
      routing configuration to a limited set of xDS compliant clients. In
      their xDS requests to load balancer, xDS clients present node metadata.
      When there is a match, the relevant configuration is made available to
      those proxies. Otherwise, all the resources (e.g. TargetHttpProxy,
      UrlMap) referenced by the ForwardingRule are not visible to those
      proxies. For each metadataFilter in this list, if its
      filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the
      filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the
      metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of
      its filterLabels must match with corresponding labels provided in the
      metadata. If multiple metadataFilters are specified, all of them need to
      be satisfied in order to be considered a match. metadataFilters
      specified here will be applifed before those specified in the UrlMap
      that this ForwardingRule references. metadataFilters only applies to
      Loadbalancers that have their loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash. For Private Service Connect forwarding rules that
      forward traffic to Google APIs, the forwarding rule name must be a 1-20
      characters string with lowercase letters and numbers and must start with
      a letter.
    network: This field is not used for external load balancing. For Internal
      TCP/UDP Load Balancing, this field identifies the network that the load
      balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If this field is
      not specified, the default network will be used. For Private Service
      Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google APIs, a network
      must be provided.
    networkTier: This signifies the networking tier used for configuring this
      load balancer and can only take the following values: PREMIUM, STANDARD.
      For regional ForwardingRule, the valid values are PREMIUM and STANDARD.
      For GlobalForwardingRule, the valid value is PREMIUM. If this field is
      not specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM. If IPAddress is specified,
      this value must be equal to the networkTier of the Address.
    noAutomateDnsZone: This is used in PSC consumer ForwardingRule to control
      whether it should try to auto-generate a DNS zone or not. Non-PSC
      forwarding rules do not use this field.
    portRange: This field can only be used: - If IPProtocol is one of TCP,
      UDP, or SCTP. - By backend service-based network load balancers, target
      pool-based network load balancers, internal proxy load balancers,
      external proxy load balancers, Traffic Director, external protocol
      forwarding, and Classic VPN. Some products have restrictions on what
      ports can be used. See port specifications for details. Only packets
      addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to the
      backends configured with this forwarding rule. The ports, port_range,
      and allPorts fields are mutually exclusive. For external forwarding
      rules, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same [IPAddress,
      IPProtocol] pair, and cannot have overlapping portRanges. For internal
      forwarding rules within the same VPC network, two or more forwarding
      rules cannot use the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair, and cannot have
      overlapping portRanges. @pattern: \\d+(?:-\\d+)?
    ports: This field can only be used: - If IPProtocol is one of TCP, UDP, or
      SCTP. - By internal TCP/UDP load balancers, backend service-based
      network load balancers, and internal protocol forwarding. You can
      specify a list of up to five ports by number, separated by commas. The
      ports can be contiguous or discontiguous. Only packets addressed to
      these ports will be forwarded to the backends configured with this
      forwarding rule. For external forwarding rules, two or more forwarding
      rules cannot use the same [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair, and cannot share
      any values defined in ports. For internal forwarding rules within the
      same VPC network, two or more forwarding rules cannot use the same
      [IPAddress, IPProtocol] pair, and cannot share any values defined in
      ports. The ports, port_range, and allPorts fields are mutually
      exclusive. @pattern: \\d+(?:-\\d+)?
    pscConnectionId: [Output Only] The PSC connection id of the PSC Forwarding
      Rule.
    pscConnectionStatus: A PscConnectionStatusValueValuesEnum attribute.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional forwarding rule
      resides. This field is not applicable to global forwarding rules. You
      must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not
      settable as a field in the request body.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    selfLinkWithId: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource with
      the resource id.
    serviceDirectoryRegistrations: Service Directory resources to register
      this forwarding rule with. Currently, only supports a single Service
      Directory resource.
    serviceLabel: An optional prefix to the service name for this Forwarding
      Rule. If specified, the prefix is the first label of the fully qualified
      service name. The label must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with
      RFC1035. Specifically, the label must be 1-63 characters long and match
      the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the
      first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters
      must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character,
      which cannot be a dash. This field is only used for internal load
      balancing.
    serviceName: [Output Only] The internal fully qualified service name for
      this Forwarding Rule. This field is only used for internal load
      balancing.
    sourceIpRanges: If not empty, this Forwarding Rule will only forward the
      traffic when the source IP address matches one of the IP addresses or
      CIDR ranges set here. Note that a Forwarding Rule can only have up to 64
      source IP ranges, and this field can only be used with a regional
      Forwarding Rule whose scheme is EXTERNAL. Each source_ip_range entry
      should be either an IP address (for example, 1.2.3.4) or a CIDR range
      (for example, 1.2.3.0/24).
    subnetwork: This field identifies the subnetwork that the load balanced IP
      should belong to for this Forwarding Rule, used in internal load
      balancing and network load balancing with IPv6. If the network specified
      is in auto subnet mode, this field is optional. However, a subnetwork
      must be specified if the network is in custom subnet mode or when
      creating external forwarding rule with IPv6.
    target: The URL of the target resource to receive the matched traffic. For
      regional forwarding rules, this target must be in the same region as the
      forwarding rule. For global forwarding rules, this target must be a
      global load balancing resource. The forwarded traffic must be of a type
      appropriate to the target object. For more information, see the "Target"
      column in [Port specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-
      balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications). For
      Private Service Connect forwarding rules that forward traffic to Google
      APIs, provide the name of a supported Google API bundle: - vpc-sc - APIs
      that support VPC Service Controls. - all-apis - All supported Google
      APIs.

      origin resource sharing (CORS), see Fetch API Living Standard. Not
      supported when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy.
    faultInjectionPolicy: The specification for fault injection introduced
      into traffic to test the resiliency of clients to backend service
      failure. As part of fault injection, when clients send requests to a
      backend service, delays can be introduced by a load balancer on a
      percentage of requests before sending those requests to the backend
      service. Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the load
      balancer for a percentage of requests. timeout and retry_policy is
      ignored by clients that are configured with a fault_injection_policy if:
      1. The traffic is generated by fault injection AND 2. The fault
      injection is not a delay fault injection. Fault injection is not
      supported with the global external HTTP(S) load balancer (classic). To
      see which load balancers support fault injection, see Load balancing:
      Routing and traffic management features.
    maxStreamDuration: Specifies the maximum duration (timeout) for streams on
      the selected route. Unlike the timeout field where the timeout duration
      starts from the time the request has been fully processed (known as
      *end-of-stream*), the duration in this field is computed from the
      beginning of the stream until the response has been processed, including
      all retries. A stream that does not complete in this duration is closed.
      If not specified, this field uses the maximum maxStreamDuration value
      among all backend services associated with the route. This field is only
      allowed if the Url map is used with backend services with
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    requestMirrorPolicy: Specifies the policy on how requests intended for the
      route's backends are shadowed to a separate mirrored backend service.
      The load balancer does not wait for responses from the shadow service.
      Before sending traffic to the shadow service, the host / authority
      header is suffixed with -shadow. Not supported when the URL map is bound
      to a target gRPC proxy that has the validateForProxyless field set to
      true.
    retryPolicy: Specifies the retry policy associated with this route.
    timeout: Specifies the timeout for the selected route. Timeout is computed
      from the time the request has been fully processed (known as *end-of-
      stream*) up until the response has been processed. Timeout includes all
      retries. If not specified, this field uses the largest timeout among all
      backend services associated with the route. Not supported when the URL
      map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field
      set to true.
    urlRewrite: The spec to modify the URL of the request, before forwarding
      the request to the matched service. urlRewrite is the only action
      supported in UrlMaps for external HTTP(S) load balancers. Not supported
      when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has the

    weightedBackendServices: A list of weighted backend services to send
      traffic to when a route match occurs. The weights determine the fraction
      of traffic that flows to their corresponding backend service. If all
      traffic needs to go to a single backend service, there must be one
      weightedBackendService with weight set to a non-zero number. After a
      backend service is identified and before forwarding the request to the

  Fields:
    customErrorResponsePolicy: customErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the
      Load Balancer returns error responses when BackendServiceor
      BackendBucket responds with an error. If a policy for an error code is
      not configured for the RouteRule, a policy for the error code configured
      in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. If one is
      not specified in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy, the
      policy configured in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes
      effect. For example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration:
      - UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy are configured with policies
      for 5xx and 4xx errors - A RouteRule for /coming_soon/ is configured for
      the error code 404. If the request is for www.myotherdomain.com and a
      404 is encountered, the policy under
      UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If a 404 response
      is encountered for the request www.example.com/current_events/, the
      pathMatcher's policy takes effect. If however, the request for
      www.example.com/coming_soon/ encounters a 404, the policy in
      RouteRule.customErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If any of the requests
      in this example encounter a 500 error code, the policy at
      UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. When used in
      conjunction with routeRules.routeAction.retryPolicy, retries take
      precedence. Only once all retries are exhausted, the
      customErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a retry, if load
      balancer is successful in reaching the service, the
      customErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from the service
      is returned to the client. customErrorResponsePolicy is supported only
      for Global External HTTP(S) load balancing.
    description: The short description conveying the intent of this routeRule.
      The description can have a maximum length of 1024 characters.

      type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Struct Not supported when the URL
      map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field
      set to true.
    matchRules: The list of criteria for matching attributes of a request to
      this routeRule. This list has OR semantics: the request matches this
      routeRule when any of the matchRules are satisfied. However predicates
      within a given matchRule have AND semantics. All predicates within a
      matchRule must match for the request to match the rule.
    priority: For routeRules within a given pathMatcher, priority determines
      the order in which a load balancer interprets routeRules. RouteRules are
      evaluated in order of priority, from the lowest to highest number. The
      priority of a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3, N+1). The
      first rule that matches the request is applied. You cannot configure two
      or more routeRules with the same priority. Priority for each rule must
      be set to a number from 0 to 2147483647 inclusive. Priority numbers can
      have gaps, which enable you to add or remove rules in the future without
      affecting the rest of the rules. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16
      is a valid series of priority numbers to which you could add rules
      numbered from 6 to 8, 10 to 11, and 13 to 15 in the future without any
      impact on existing rules.
    routeAction: In response to a matching matchRule, the load balancer
      performs advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites and header
      transformations, before forwarding the request to the selected backend.
      If routeAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, service must not
      be set. Conversely if service is set, routeAction cannot contain any
      weightedBackendServices. Only one of urlRedirect, service or
      routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set. URL maps for Classic
      external HTTP(S) load balancers only support the urlRewrite action
      within a route rule's routeAction.
    service: The full or partial URL of the backend service resource to which
      traffic is directed if this rule is matched. If routeAction is also
      specified, advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites, take effect
      before sending the request to the backend. However, if service is

      Conversely, if routeAction specifies any weightedBackendServices,
      service must not be specified. Only one of urlRedirect, service or
      routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.
    urlRedirect: When this rule is matched, the request is redirected to a URL

    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    diskSizeGb: Size of the image when restored onto a persistent disk (in
      GB).
    family: The name of the image family to which this image belongs. You can
      create disks by specifying an image family instead of a specific image
      name. The image family always returns its latest image that is not
      deprecated. The name of the image family must comply with RFC1035.
    guestOsFeatures: A list of features to enable on the guest operating
      system. Applicable only for bootable images. To see a list of available
      options, see the guestOSfeatures[].type parameter.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    imageEncryptionKey: Encrypts the image using a customer-supplied
      encryption key. After you encrypt an image with a customer-supplied key,
      you must provide the same key if you use the image later (e.g. to create
      a disk from the image). Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect
      access to metadata of the disk. If you do not provide an encryption key
      when creating the image, then the disk will be encrypted using an
      automatically generated key and you do not need to provide a key to use
      the image later.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#image for images.
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this
      image, which is essentially a hash of the labels used for optimistic
      locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and
      changes after every request to modify or update labels. You must always
      provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change
      labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet.

      to this image.
    licenses: Any applicable license URI.
    locked: A flag for marketplace VM disk created from the image, which is
      designed for marketplace VM disk to prevent the proprietary data on the
      disk from being accessed unwantedly. The flag will be inherited by the
      disk created from the image. The disk with locked flag set to true will
      be prohibited from performing the operations below: - R/W or R/O disk
      attach - Disk detach, if disk is created via create-on-create - Create
      images - Create snapshots - Create disk clone (create disk from the

      cannot be a dash.
    rawDisk: The parameters of the raw disk image.
    rolloutOverride: A rollout policy to apply to this image. When specified,
      the rollout policy overrides per-zone references to the image via the
      associated image family. The rollout policy restricts the zones where
      this image is accessible when using a zonal image family reference. When
      the rollout policy does not include the user specified zone, or if the
      zone is rolled out, this image is accessible. The rollout policy for
      this image is read-only, except for allowlisted users. This field might

    eraseWindowsVssSignature: Specifies whether the disks restored from source
      snapshots or source machine image should erase Windows specific VSS
      signature.
    fingerprint: Specifies a fingerprint for this resource, which is
      essentially a hash of the instance's contents and used for optimistic
      locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and
      changes after every request to modify or update the instance. You must
      always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update the

    instanceEncryptionKey: Encrypts or decrypts data for an instance with a
      customer-supplied encryption key. If you are creating a new instance,
      this field encrypts the local SSD and in-memory contents of the instance
      using a key that you provide. If you are restarting an instance
      protected with a customer-supplied encryption key, you must provide the
      correct key in order to successfully restart the instance. If you do not
      provide an encryption key when creating the instance, then the local SSD
      and in-memory contents will be encrypted using an automatically
      generated key and you do not need to provide a key to start the instance
      later. Instance templates do not store customer-supplied encryption
      keys, so you cannot use your own keys to encrypt local SSDs and in-
      memory content in a managed instance group.
    keyRevocationActionType: KeyRevocationActionType of the instance.
      Supported options are "STOP" and "NONE". The default value is "NONE" if

      hash of the label's contents and used for optimistic locking. The
      fingerprint is initially generated by Compute Engine and changes after
      every request to modify or update labels. You must always provide an up-
      to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or change labels. To see the
      latest fingerprint, make get() request to the instance.
    labels: Labels to apply to this instance. These can be later modified by
      the setLabels method.
    lastStartTimestamp: [Output Only] Last start timestamp in RFC3339 text

    machineType: Full or partial URL of the machine type resource to use for
      this instance, in the format: zones/zone/machineTypes/machine-type. This
      is provided by the client when the instance is created. For example, the
      following is a valid partial url to a predefined machine type: zones/us-
      central1-f/machineTypes/n1-standard-1 To create a custom machine type,
      provide a URL to a machine type in the following format, where CPUS is 1
      or an even number up to 32 (2, 4, 6, ... 24, etc), and MEMORY is the
      total memory for this instance. Memory must be a multiple of 256 MB and
      must be supplied in MB (e.g. 5 GB of memory is 5120 MB):

      minCpuPlatform: "Intel Haswell" or minCpuPlatform: "Intel Sandy Bridge".
    name: The name of the resource, provided by the client when initially
      creating the resource. The resource name must be 1-63 characters long,
      and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters
      long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which
      means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.
    networkInterfaces: An array of network configurations for this instance.

  r"""Represents a machine image resource. A machine image is a Compute Engine
  resource that stores all the configuration, metadata, permissions, and data
  from one or more disks required to create a Virtual machine (VM) instance.
  For more information, see Machine images.

  Enums:
    StatusValueValuesEnum: [Output Only] The status of the machine image. One
      of the following values: INVALID, CREATING, READY, DELETING, and
      UPLOADING.

  Fields:
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] The creation timestamp for this machine
      image in RFC3339 text format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    guestFlush: [Input Only] Whether to attempt an application consistent
      machine image by informing the OS to prepare for the snapshot process.
    id: [Output Only] A unique identifier for this machine image. The server
      defines this identifier.
    instanceProperties: [Output Only] Properties of source instance
    kind: [Output Only] The resource type, which is always
      compute#machineImage for machine image.
    machineImageEncryptionKey: Encrypts the machine image using a customer-
      supplied encryption key. After you encrypt a machine image using a
      customer-supplied key, you must provide the same key if you use the
      machine image later. For example, you must provide the encryption key
      when you create an instance from the encrypted machine image in a future
      request. Customer-supplied encryption keys do not protect access to
      metadata of the machine image. If you do not provide an encryption key
      when creating the machine image, then the machine image will be
      encrypted using an automatically generated key and you do not need to
      provide a key to use the machine image later.
    name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    satisfiesPzs: [Output Only] Reserved for future use.
    savedDisks: An array of Machine Image specific properties for disks
      attached to the source instance
    selfLink: [Output Only] The URL for this machine image. The server defines
      this URL.
    selfLinkWithId: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource with
      the resource id.
    sourceDiskEncryptionKeys: [Input Only] The customer-supplied encryption
      key of the disks attached to the source instance. Required if the source
      disk is protected by a customer-supplied encryption key.
    sourceInstance: The source instance used to create the machine image. You
      can provide this as a partial or full URL to the resource. For example,
      the following are valid values: -
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone
      /instances/instance - projects/project/zones/zone/instances/instance
    sourceInstanceProperties: [Output Only] DEPRECATED: Please use
      instance_properties instead for source instance related properties. New
      properties will not be added to this field.
    status: [Output Only] The status of the machine image. One of the
      following values: INVALID, CREATING, READY, DELETING, and UPLOADING.
    storageLocations: The regional or multi-regional Cloud Storage bucket
      location where the machine image is stored.

  Fields:
    accessConfigs: An array of configurations for this interface. Currently,
      only one access config, ONE_TO_ONE_NAT, is supported. If there are no
      accessConfigs specified, then this instance will have no external
      internet access.
    aliasIpRanges: An array of alias IP ranges for this network interface. You
      can only specify this field for network interfaces in VPC networks.
    fingerprint: Fingerprint hash of contents stored in this network
      interface. This field will be ignored when inserting an Instance or
      adding a NetworkInterface. An up-to-date fingerprint must be provided in
      order to update the NetworkInterface. The request will fail with error
      400 Bad Request if the fingerprint is not provided, or 412 Precondition
      Failed if the fingerprint is out of date.
    internalIpv6PrefixLength: The prefix length of the primary internal IPv6
      range.
    ipv6AccessConfigs: An array of IPv6 access configurations for this
      interface. Currently, only one IPv6 access config, DIRECT_IPV6, is
      supported. If there is no ipv6AccessConfig specified, then this instance

    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#networkInterface
      for network interfaces.
    name: [Output Only] The name of the network interface, which is generated
      by the server. For a VM, the network interface uses the nicN naming
      format. Where N is a value between 0 and 7. The default interface value
      is nic0.
    network: URL of the VPC network resource for this instance. When creating
      an instance, if neither the network nor the subnetwork is specified, the
      default network global/networks/default is used. If the selected project
      doesn't have the default network, you must specify a network or subnet.
      If the network is not specified but the subnetwork is specified, the
      network is inferred. If you specify this property, you can specify the
      network as a full or partial URL. For example, the following are all

      should connect to in the following format: projects/{project_number}/reg
      ions/{region_name}/networkAttachments/{network_attachment_name}.
    networkIP: An IPv4 internal IP address to assign to the instance for this
      network interface. If not specified by the user, an unused internal IP
      is assigned by the system.
    nicType: The type of vNIC to be used on this interface. This may be gVNIC
      or VirtioNet.
    queueCount: The networking queue count that's specified by users for the
      network interface. Both Rx and Tx queues will be set to this number.
      It'll be empty if not specified by the users.
    stackType: The stack type for this network interface to identify whether
      the IPv6 feature is enabled or not. If not specified, IPV4_ONLY will be
      used. This field can be both set at instance creation and update network
      interface operations.
    subinterfaces: SubInterfaces help enable L2 communication for the instance
      over subnetworks that support L2. Every network interface will get a
      default untagged (vlan not specified) subinterface. Users can specify
      additional tagged subinterfaces which are sub-fields to the Network
      Interface.
    subnetwork: The URL of the Subnetwork resource for this instance. If the
      network resource is in legacy mode, do not specify this field. If the
      network is in auto subnet mode, specifying the subnetwork is optional.
      If the network is in custom subnet mode, specifying the subnetwork is
      required. If you specify this field, you can specify the subnetwork as a

  r"""A matcher for the path portion of the URL. The BackendService from the
  longest-matched rule will serve the URL. If no rule was matched, the default
  service is used.

  Fields:
    defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy: defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy
      specifies how the Load Balancer returns error responses when
      BackendServiceor BackendBucket responds with an error. This policy takes
      effect at the PathMatcher level and applies only when no policy has been
      defined for the error code at lower levels like RouteRule and PathRule
      within this PathMatcher. If an error code does not have a policy defined
      in defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy, then a policy defined for the error
      code in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. For
      example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration: -
      UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is configured with policies for
      5xx and 4xx errors - A RouteRule for /coming_soon/ is configured for the
      error code 404. If the request is for www.myotherdomain.com and a 404 is
      encountered, the policy under UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy
      takes effect. If a 404 response is encountered for the request
      www.example.com/current_events/, the pathMatcher's policy takes effect.
      If however, the request for www.example.com/coming_soon/ encounters a
      404, the policy in RouteRule.customErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If
      any of the requests in this example encounter a 500 error code, the
      policy at UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. When
      used in conjunction with pathMatcher.defaultRouteAction.retryPolicy,
      retries take precedence. Only once all retries are exhausted, the
      defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a retry,
      if load balancer is successful in reaching the service, the
      defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from the
      service is returned to the client. defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is
      supported only for Global External HTTP(S) load balancing.
    defaultRouteAction: defaultRouteAction takes effect when none of the
      pathRules or routeRules match. The load balancer performs advanced
      routing actions, such as URL rewrites and header transformations, before
      forwarding the request to the selected backend. If defaultRouteAction
      specifies any weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be set.
      Conversely if defaultService is set, defaultRouteAction cannot contain
      any weightedBackendServices. Only one of defaultRouteAction or
      defaultUrlRedirect must be set. URL maps for Classic external HTTP(S)
      load balancers only support the urlRewrite action within a path
      matcher's defaultRouteAction.
    defaultService: The full or partial URL to the BackendService resource.
      This URL is used if none of the pathRules or routeRules defined by this
      PathMatcher are matched. For example, the following are all valid URLs
      to a BackendService resource: -
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project
      /global/backendServices/backendService -
      compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendServices/backendService -
      global/backendServices/backendService If defaultRouteAction is also
      specified, advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites, take effect
      before sending the request to the backend. However, if defaultService is
      specified, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any
      weightedBackendServices. Conversely, if defaultRouteAction specifies any
      weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be specified. Only one
      of defaultService, defaultUrlRedirect , or
      defaultRouteAction.weightedBackendService must be set. Authorization
      requires one or more of the following Google IAM permissions on the
      specified resource default_service: - compute.backendBuckets.use -
      compute.backendServices.use
    defaultUrlRedirect: When none of the specified pathRules or routeRules
      match, the request is redirected to a URL specified by
      defaultUrlRedirect. If defaultUrlRedirect is specified, defaultService
      or defaultRouteAction must not be set. Not supported when the URL map is

    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this

    customErrorResponsePolicy: customErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the

      BackendBucket responds with an error. If a policy for an error code is
      not configured for the PathRule, a policy for the error code configured
      in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. If one is
      not specified in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy, the
      policy configured in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes
      effect. For example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration:
      - UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy are configured with policies
      for 5xx and 4xx errors - A PathRule for /coming_soon/ is configured for
      the error code 404. If the request is for www.myotherdomain.com and a
      404 is encountered, the policy under
      UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If a 404 response
      is encountered for the request www.example.com/current_events/, the
      pathMatcher's policy takes effect. If however, the request for
      www.example.com/coming_soon/ encounters a 404, the policy in
      PathRule.customErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If any of the requests
      in this example encounter a 500 error code, the policy at
      UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect.
      customErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for Global External HTTP(S)
      load balancing.
    paths: The list of path patterns to match. Each must start with / and the
      only place a * is allowed is at the end following a /. The string fed to
      the path matcher does not include any text after the first ? or #, and
      those chars are not allowed here.
    routeAction: In response to a matching path, the load balancer performs
      advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites and header
      transformations, before forwarding the request to the selected backend.
      If routeAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, service must not
      be set. Conversely if service is set, routeAction cannot contain any
      weightedBackendServices. Only one of routeAction or urlRedirect must be
      set. URL maps for Classic external HTTP(S) load balancers only support
      the urlRewrite action within a path rule's routeAction.
    service: The full or partial URL of the backend service resource to which
      traffic is directed if this rule is matched. If routeAction is also
      specified, advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites, take effect
      before sending the request to the backend. However, if service is
      specified, routeAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices.
      Conversely, if routeAction specifies any weightedBackendServices,
      service must not be specified. Only one of urlRedirect, service or
      routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set.
    urlRedirect: When a path pattern is matched, the request is redirected to

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: -
  user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com -
  serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role:
  roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com

  version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    rules: This is deprecated and has no effect. Do not use.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-

      created yet. - `READY_TO_ANNOUNCE` The public delegated prefix is a live
      migration prefix and is active. - `ANNOUNCED` The public delegated
      prefix is active. - `DELETING` The public delegated prefix is being
      deprovsioned.

  Fields:
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored
      in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field
      will be ignored when inserting a new PublicDelegatedPrefix. An up-to-
      date fingerprint must be provided in order to update the
      PublicDelegatedPrefix, otherwise the request will fail with error 412
      conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to
      retrieve a PublicDelegatedPrefix.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource type. The server
      generates this identifier.
    ipCidrRange: The IPv4 address range, in CIDR format, represented by this
      public delegated prefix.
    isLiveMigration: If true, the prefix will be live migrated.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always
      compute#publicDelegatedPrefix for public delegated prefixes.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    parentPrefix: The URL of parent prefix. Either PublicAdvertisedPrefix or
      PublicDelegatedPrefix.
    publicDelegatedSubPrefixs: The list of sub public delegated prefixes that
      exist for this public delegated prefix.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the public delegated prefix
      resides. This field applies only to the region resource. You must
      specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable
      as a field in the request body.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    selfLinkWithId: [Output Only] Server-defined URL with id for the resource.
    status: [Output Only] The status of the public delegated prefix, which can
      be one of following values: - `INITIALIZING` The public delegated prefix
      is being initialized and addresses cannot be created yet. -
      `READY_TO_ANNOUNCE` The public delegated prefix is a live migration

    latencyTolerant: Defines whether the instance is tolerant of higher cpu
      latency. This can only be set during instance creation, or when the
      instance is not currently running. It must not be set if the preemptible
      option is also set.

class SecurityPolicyRule(_messages.Message):
  r"""Represents a rule that describes one or more match conditions along with
  the action to be taken when traffic matches this condition (allow or deny).

  Enums:
    DirectionValueValuesEnum: The direction in which this rule applies. This
      field may only be specified when versioned_expr is set to FIREWALL.
    RuleManagedProtectionTierValueValuesEnum: [Output Only] The minimum
      managed protection tier required for this rule.

  Fields:
    action: The Action to perform when the rule is matched. The following are
      the valid actions: - allow: allow access to target. - deny(): deny
      access to target, returns the HTTP response code specified (valid values
      are 403, 404, and 502). - rate_based_ban: limit client traffic to the
      configured threshold and ban the client if the traffic exceeds the
      threshold. Configure parameters for this action in RateLimitOptions.
      Requires rate_limit_options to be set. - redirect: redirect to a
      different target. This can either be an internal reCAPTCHA redirect, or
      an external URL-based redirect via a 302 response. Parameters for this
      action can be configured via redirectOptions. - throttle: limit client
      traffic to the configured threshold. Configure parameters for this
      action in rateLimitOptions. Requires rate_limit_options to be set for
      this.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    direction: The direction in which this rule applies. This field may only
      be specified when versioned_expr is set to FIREWALL.
    enableLogging: Denotes whether to enable logging for a particular rule. If
      logging is enabled, logs will be exported to the configured export
      destination in Stackdriver. Logs may be exported to BigQuery or Pub/Sub.
      Note: you cannot enable logging on "goto_next" rules. This field may
      only be specified when the versioned_expr is set to FIREWALL.
    headerAction: Optional, additional actions that are performed on headers.
    kind: [Output only] Type of the resource. Always
      compute#securityPolicyRule for security policy rules
    match: A match condition that incoming traffic is evaluated against. If it
      evaluates to true, the corresponding 'action' is enforced.
    networkMatch: A match condition that incoming packets are evaluated
      against for CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK security policies. If it matches, the
      corresponding 'action' is enforced. The match criteria for a rule
      consists of built-in match fields (like 'srcIpRanges') and potentially
      multiple user-defined match fields ('userDefinedFields'). Field values
      may be extracted directly from the packet or derived from it (e.g.
      'srcRegionCodes'). Some fields may not be present in every packet (e.g.
      'srcPorts'). A user-defined field is only present if the base header is
      found in the packet and the entire field is in bounds. Each match field
      may specify which values can match it, listing one or more ranges,
      prefixes, or exact values that are considered a match for the field. A
      field value must be present in order to match a specified match field.
      If no match values are specified for a match field, then any field value
      is considered to match it, and it's not required to be present. For
      strings specifying '*' is also equivalent to match all. For a packet to
      match a rule, all specified match fields must match the corresponding
      field values derived from the packet. Example: networkMatch:
      srcIpRanges: - "192.0.2.0/24" - "198.51.100.0/24" userDefinedFields: -
      name: "ipv4_fragment_offset" values: - "1-0x1fff" The above match
      condition matches packets with a source IP in 192.0.2.0/24 or
      198.51.100.0/24 and a user-defined field named "ipv4_fragment_offset"
      with a value between 1 and 0x1fff inclusive.
    preconfiguredWafConfig: Preconfigured WAF configuration to be applied for
      the rule. If the rule does not evaluate preconfigured WAF rules, i.e.,
      if evaluatePreconfiguredWaf() is not used, this field will have no
      effect.
    preview: If set to true, the specified action is not enforced.
    priority: An integer indicating the priority of a rule in the list. The
      priority must be a positive value between 0 and 2147483647. Rules are
      evaluated from highest to lowest priority where 0 is the highest
      priority and 2147483647 is the lowest priority.
    rateLimitOptions: Must be specified if the action is "rate_based_ban" or
      "throttle". Cannot be specified for any other actions.
    redirectOptions: Parameters defining the redirect action. Cannot be
      specified for any other actions.
    redirectTarget: This must be specified for redirect actions. Cannot be
      specified for any other actions.
    ruleManagedProtectionTier: [Output Only] The minimum managed protection
      tier required for this rule.
    ruleNumber: Identifier for the rule. This is only unique within the given
      security policy. This can only be set during rule creation, if rule
      number is not specified it will be generated by the server.
    ruleTupleCount: [Output Only] Calculation of the complexity of a single
      firewall security policy rule.
    targetResources: A list of network resource URLs to which this rule
      applies. This field allows you to control which network's VMs get this
      rule. If this field is left blank, all VMs within the organization will
      receive the rule. This field may only be specified when versioned_expr

      snapshot. Valid values are ARM64 or X86_64.
    SnapshotTypeValueValuesEnum: Indicates the type of the snapshot.
    StatusValueValuesEnum: [Output Only] The status of the snapshot. This can
      be CREATING, DELETING, FAILED, READY, or UPLOADING.
    StorageBytesStatusValueValuesEnum: [Output Only] An indicator whether
      storageBytes is in a stable state or it is being adjusted as a result of
      shared storage reallocation. This status can either be UPDATING, meaning
      the size of the snapshot is being updated, or UP_TO_DATE, meaning the
      size of the snapshot is up-to-date.

  Messages:
    LabelsValue: Labels to apply to this snapshot. These can be later modified
      by the setLabels method. Label values may be empty.

  Fields:
    architecture: [Output Only] The architecture of the snapshot. Valid values
      are ARM64 or X86_64.
    autoCreated: [Output Only] Set to true if snapshots are automatically
      created by applying resource policy on the target disk.
    chainName: Creates the new snapshot in the snapshot chain labeled with the
      specified name. The chain name must be 1-63 characters long and comply
      with RFC1035. This is an uncommon option only for advanced service
      owners who needs to create separate snapshot chains, for example, for
      chargeback tracking. When you describe your snapshot resource, this
      field is visible only if it has a non-empty value.
    creationSizeBytes: [Output Only] Size in bytes of the snapshot at creation
      time.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    diskSizeGb: [Output Only] Size of the source disk, specified in GB.
    downloadBytes: [Output Only] Number of bytes downloaded to restore a
      snapshot to a disk.
    guestFlush: [Input Only] Whether to attempt an application consistent
      snapshot by informing the OS to prepare for the snapshot process.
    guestOsFeatures: [Output Only] A list of features to enable on the guest
      operating system. Applicable only for bootable images. Read Enabling
      guest operating system features to see a list of available options.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#snapshot for
      Snapshot resources.
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this
      snapshot, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for
      optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute
      Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You
      must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or
      change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412
      conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to
      retrieve a snapshot.
    labels: Labels to apply to this snapshot. These can be later modified by
      the setLabels method. Label values may be empty.
    licenseCodes: [Output Only] Integer license codes indicating which
      licenses are attached to this snapshot.
    licenses: [Output Only] A list of public visible licenses that apply to
      this snapshot. This can be because the original image had licenses
      attached (such as a Windows image).
    locationHint: An opaque location hint used to place the snapshot close to
      other resources. This field is for use by internal tools that use the
      public API.
    maxRetentionDays: Number of days the snapshot should be retained before
      being deleted automatically.
    name: Name of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    satisfiesPzs: [Output Only] Reserved for future use.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    selfLinkWithId: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource's
      resource id.
    snapshotEncryptionKey: Encrypts the snapshot using a customer-supplied
      encryption key. After you encrypt a snapshot using a customer-supplied
      key, you must provide the same key if you use the snapshot later. For
      example, you must provide the encryption key when you create a disk from
      the encrypted snapshot in a future request. Customer-supplied encryption
      keys do not protect access to metadata of the snapshot. If you do not
      provide an encryption key when creating the snapshot, then the snapshot
      will be encrypted using an automatically generated key and you do not
      need to provide a key to use the snapshot later.
    snapshotType: Indicates the type of the snapshot.
    sourceDisk: The source disk used to create this snapshot.
    sourceDiskEncryptionKey: The customer-supplied encryption key of the
      source disk. Required if the source disk is protected by a customer-
      supplied encryption key.
    sourceDiskId: [Output Only] The ID value of the disk used to create this
      snapshot. This value may be used to determine whether the snapshot was
      taken from the current or a previous instance of a given disk name.
    sourceInstantSnapshot: The source instant snapshot used to create this
      snapshot. You can provide this as a partial or full URL to the resource.
      For example, the following are valid values: -
      https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project/zones/zone
      /instantSnapshots/instantSnapshot -
      projects/project/zones/zone/instantSnapshots/instantSnapshot -
      zones/zone/instantSnapshots/instantSnapshot
    sourceInstantSnapshotId: [Output Only] The unique ID of the instant
      snapshot used to create this snapshot. This value identifies the exact
      instant snapshot that was used to create this persistent disk. For
      example, if you created the persistent disk from an instant snapshot
      that was later deleted and recreated under the same name, the source
      instant snapshot ID would identify the exact instant snapshot that was
      used.
    sourceSnapshotSchedulePolicy: [Output Only] URL of the resource policy
      which created this scheduled snapshot.
    sourceSnapshotSchedulePolicyId: [Output Only] ID of the resource policy
      which created this scheduled snapshot.
    status: [Output Only] The status of the snapshot. This can be CREATING,
      DELETING, FAILED, READY, or UPLOADING.
    storageBytes: [Output Only] A size of the storage used by the snapshot. As
      snapshots share storage, this number is expected to change with snapshot
      creation/deletion.
    storageBytesStatus: [Output Only] An indicator whether storageBytes is in
      a stable state or it is being adjusted as a result of shared storage
      reallocation. This status can either be UPDATING, meaning the size of
      the snapshot is being updated, or UP_TO_DATE, meaning the size of the
      snapshot is up-to-date.
    storageLocations: Cloud Storage bucket storage location of the snapshot

  Enums:
    AggregationIntervalValueValuesEnum: Can only be specified if VPC flow
      logging for this subnetwork is enabled. Sets the aggregation interval
      for collecting flow logs. Increasing the interval time reduces the
      amount of generated flow logs for long-lasting connections. Default is
      an interval of 5 seconds per connection. Valid values: INTERVAL_5_SEC,
      INTERVAL_30_SEC, INTERVAL_1_MIN, INTERVAL_5_MIN, INTERVAL_10_MIN,
      INTERVAL_15_MIN.
    Ipv6AccessTypeValueValuesEnum: The access type of IPv6 address this subnet
      holds. It's immutable and can only be specified during creation or the
      first time the subnet is updated into IPV4_IPV6 dual stack.
    MetadataValueValuesEnum: Can only be specified if VPC flow logging for
      this subnetwork is enabled. Configures whether metadata fields should be
      added to the reported VPC flow logs. Options are INCLUDE_ALL_METADATA,
      EXCLUDE_ALL_METADATA, and CUSTOM_METADATA. Default is
      EXCLUDE_ALL_METADATA.
    PrivateIpv6GoogleAccessValueValuesEnum: This field is for internal use.
      This field can be both set at resource creation time and updated using
      patch.
    PurposeValueValuesEnum: The purpose of the resource. This field can be
      either PRIVATE_RFC_1918 or INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER. A subnetwork
      with purpose set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER is a user-created
      subnetwork that is reserved for Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing. If
      unspecified, the purpose defaults to PRIVATE_RFC_1918. The
      enableFlowLogs field isn't supported with the purpose field set to
      INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER.
    RoleValueValuesEnum: The role of subnetwork. Currently, this field is only
      used when purpose = INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER. The value can be set
      to ACTIVE or BACKUP. An ACTIVE subnetwork is one that is currently being
      used for Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing. A BACKUP subnetwork is one
      that is ready to be promoted to ACTIVE or is currently draining. This
      field can be updated with a patch request.
    StackTypeValueValuesEnum: The stack type for the subnet. If set to
      IPV4_ONLY, new VMs in the subnet are assigned IPv4 addresses only. If
      set to IPV4_IPV6, new VMs in the subnet can be assigned both IPv4 and
      IPv6 addresses. If not specified, IPV4_ONLY is used. This field can be
      both set at resource creation time and updated using patch.
    StateValueValuesEnum: [Output Only] The state of the subnetwork, which can
      be one of the following values: READY: Subnetwork is created and ready
      to use DRAINING: only applicable to subnetworks that have the purpose
      set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER and indicates that connections to
      the load balancer are being drained. A subnetwork that is draining
      cannot be used or modified until it reaches a status of READY

  Fields:
    aggregationInterval: Can only be specified if VPC flow logging for this
      subnetwork is enabled. Sets the aggregation interval for collecting flow
      logs. Increasing the interval time reduces the amount of generated flow
      logs for long-lasting connections. Default is an interval of 5 seconds
      per connection. Valid values: INTERVAL_5_SEC, INTERVAL_30_SEC,
      INTERVAL_1_MIN, INTERVAL_5_MIN, INTERVAL_10_MIN, INTERVAL_15_MIN.
    allowSubnetCidrRoutesOverlap: Whether this subnetwork's ranges can
      conflict with existing static routes. Setting this to true allows this
      subnetwork's primary and secondary ranges to overlap with (and contain)
      static routes that have already been configured on the corresponding
      network. For example if a static route has range 10.1.0.0/16, a subnet
      range 10.0.0.0/8 could only be created if allow_conflicting_routes=true.
      Overlapping is only allowed on subnetwork operations; routes whose
      ranges conflict with this subnetwork's ranges won't be allowed unless
      route.allow_conflicting_subnetworks is set to true. Typically packets
      destined to IPs within the subnetwork (which may contain
      private/sensitive data) are prevented from leaving the virtual network.
      Setting this field to true will disable this feature. The default value
      is false and applies to all existing subnetworks and automatically
      created subnetworks. This field cannot be set to true at resource
      creation time.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource. This field can be set only at
      resource creation time.
    enableFlowLogs: Whether to enable flow logging for this subnetwork. If
      this field is not explicitly set, it will not appear in get listings. If
      not set the default behavior is determined by the org policy, if there
      is no org policy specified, then it will default to disabled. This field
      isn't supported with the purpose field set to
      INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER.
    enableL2: Enables Layer2 communication on the subnetwork.
    enablePrivateV6Access: Deprecated in favor of enable in
      PrivateIpv6GoogleAccess. Whether the VMs in this subnet can directly
      access Google services via internal IPv6 addresses. This field can be
      both set at resource creation time and updated using patch.
    externalIpv6Prefix: The external IPv6 address range that is owned by this
      subnetwork.
    fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored
      in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field
      will be ignored when inserting a Subnetwork. An up-to-date fingerprint
      must be provided in order to update the Subnetwork, otherwise the
      request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest
      fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve a Subnetwork.
    flowSampling: Can only be specified if VPC flow logging for this
      subnetwork is enabled. The value of the field must be in [0, 1]. Set the
      sampling rate of VPC flow logs within the subnetwork where 1.0 means all
      collected logs are reported and 0.0 means no logs are reported. Default
      is 0.5 unless otherwise specified by the org policy, which means half of
      all collected logs are reported.
    gatewayAddress: [Output Only] The gateway address for default routes to
      reach destination addresses outside this subnetwork.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    internalIpv6Prefix: [Output Only] The internal IPv6 address range that is

    ipCidrRange: The range of internal addresses that are owned by this
      subnetwork. Provide this property when you create the subnetwork. For
      example, 10.0.0.0/8 or 100.64.0.0/10. Ranges must be unique and non-
      overlapping within a network. Only IPv4 is supported. This field is set
      at resource creation time. The range can be any range listed in the
      Valid ranges list. The range can be expanded after creation using
      expandIpCidrRange.
    ipv6AccessType: The access type of IPv6 address this subnet holds. It's
      immutable and can only be specified during creation or the first time
      the subnet is updated into IPV4_IPV6 dual stack.
    ipv6CidrRange: [Output Only] This field is for internal use.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#subnetwork for
      Subnetwork resources.
    logConfig: This field denotes the VPC flow logging options for this
      subnetwork. If logging is enabled, logs are exported to Cloud Logging.
    metadata: Can only be specified if VPC flow logging for this subnetwork is
      enabled. Configures whether metadata fields should be added to the
      reported VPC flow logs. Options are INCLUDE_ALL_METADATA,
      EXCLUDE_ALL_METADATA, and CUSTOM_METADATA. Default is
      EXCLUDE_ALL_METADATA.
    name: The name of the resource, provided by the client when initially
      creating the resource. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply
      with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and
      match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means
      the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following
      characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last
      character, which cannot be a dash.
    network: The URL of the network to which this subnetwork belongs, provided
      by the client when initially creating the subnetwork. This field can be
      set only at resource creation time.
    privateIpGoogleAccess: Whether the VMs in this subnet can access Google
      services without assigned external IP addresses. This field can be both
      set at resource creation time and updated using
      setPrivateIpGoogleAccess.
    privateIpv6GoogleAccess: This field is for internal use. This field can be
      both set at resource creation time and updated using patch.
    purpose: The purpose of the resource. This field can be either
      PRIVATE_RFC_1918 or INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER. A subnetwork with
      purpose set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER is a user-created subnetwork
      that is reserved for Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing. If unspecified,
      the purpose defaults to PRIVATE_RFC_1918. The enableFlowLogs field isn't
      supported with the purpose field set to INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER.
    region: URL of the region where the Subnetwork resides. This field can be
      set only at resource creation time.
    reservedInternalRange: The URL of the reserved internal range.
    role: The role of subnetwork. Currently, this field is only used when
      purpose = INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER. The value can be set to ACTIVE
      or BACKUP. An ACTIVE subnetwork is one that is currently being used for
      Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing. A BACKUP subnetwork is one that is
      ready to be promoted to ACTIVE or is currently draining. This field can
      be updated with a patch request.
    secondaryIpRanges: An array of configurations for secondary IP ranges for
      VM instances contained in this subnetwork. The primary IP of such VM
      must belong to the primary ipCidrRange of the subnetwork. The alias IPs
      may belong to either primary or secondary ranges. This field can be
      updated with a patch request.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    selfLinkWithId: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource with
      the resource id.
    stackType: The stack type for the subnet. If set to IPV4_ONLY, new VMs in
      the subnet are assigned IPv4 addresses only. If set to IPV4_IPV6, new
      VMs in the subnet can be assigned both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. If not
      specified, IPV4_ONLY is used. This field can be both set at resource
      creation time and updated using patch.
    state: [Output Only] The state of the subnetwork, which can be one of the
      following values: READY: Subnetwork is created and ready to use
      DRAINING: only applicable to subnetworks that have the purpose set to
      INTERNAL_HTTPS_LOAD_BALANCER and indicates that connections to the load
      balancer are being drained. A subnetwork that is draining cannot be used
      or modified until it reaches a status of READY
    vlans: A repeated field indicating the VLAN IDs supported on this
      subnetwork. During Subnet creation, specifying vlan is valid only if
      enable_l2 is true. During Subnet Update, specifying vlan is allowed only
      for l2 enabled subnets. Restricted to only one VLAN.

    balancers. Not supported by target pools. The health check supports all
    backends supported by the backend service provided the backend can be
    health checked. For example, GCE_VM_IP network endpoint groups,
    GCE_VM_IP_PORT network endpoint groups, and instance group backends.

    through load balancers. Supports all backends that can be health checked;
    for example, GCE_VM_IP_PORT network endpoint groups and instance group
    backends. For GCE_VM_IP_PORT network endpoint group backends, the health
    check uses the port number specified for each endpoint in the network
    endpoint group. For instance group backends, the health check uses the
    port number determined by looking up the backend service's named port in
    the instance group's list of named ports.

    Values:
      USE_FIXED_PORT: The port number in the health check's port is used for
        health checking. Applies to network endpoint group and instance group
        backends.

      USE_SERVING_PORT: For network endpoint group backends, the health check
        uses the port number specified on each endpoint in the network
        endpoint group. For instance group backends, the health check uses the

      is not specified, NONE is implied.

  Fields:
    authentication: [Deprecated] Use serverTlsPolicy instead.
    authorization: [Deprecated] Use authorizationPolicy instead.
    authorizationPolicy: Optional. A URL referring to a
      networksecurity.AuthorizationPolicy resource that describes how the
      proxy should authorize inbound traffic. If left blank, access will not
      be restricted by an authorization policy. Refer to the
      AuthorizationPolicy resource for additional details. authorizationPolicy
      only applies to a global TargetHttpsProxy attached to
      globalForwardingRules with the loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. Note: This field currently has no impact.
    certificateMap: URL of a certificate map that identifies a certificate map
      associated with the given target proxy. This field can only be set for
      global target proxies. If set, sslCertificates will be ignored.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored
      in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field
      will be ignored when inserting a TargetHttpsProxy. An up-to-date
      fingerprint must be provided in order to patch the TargetHttpsProxy;
      otherwise, the request will fail with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see
      the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to retrieve the
      TargetHttpsProxy.
    httpFilters: URLs to networkservices.HttpFilter resources enabled for xDS
      clients using this configuration. For example,
      https://networkservices.googleapis.com/beta/projects/project/locations/
      locationhttpFilters/httpFilter Only filters that handle outbound
      connection and stream events may be specified. These filters work in
      conjunction with a default set of HTTP filters that may already be
      configured by Traffic Director. Traffic Director will determine the
      final location of these filters within xDS configuration based on the
      name of the HTTP filter. If Traffic Director positions multiple filters
      at the same location, those filters will be in the same order as
      specified in this list. httpFilters only applies for loadbalancers with
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. See ForwardingRule for
      more details.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#targetHttpsProxy for
      target HTTPS proxies.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    proxyBind: This field only applies when the forwarding rule that
      references this target proxy has a loadBalancingScheme set to
      INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. When this field is set to true, Envoy proxies set
      up inbound traffic interception and bind to the IP address and port
      specified in the forwarding rule. This is generally useful when using
      Traffic Director to configure Envoy as a gateway or middle proxy (in
      other words, not a sidecar proxy). The Envoy proxy listens for inbound
      requests and handles requests when it receives them. The default is
      false.
    quicOverride: Specifies the QUIC override policy for this TargetHttpsProxy
      resource. This setting determines whether the load balancer attempts to
      negotiate QUIC with clients. You can specify NONE, ENABLE, or DISABLE. -
      When quic-override is set to NONE, Google manages whether QUIC is used.
      - When quic-override is set to ENABLE, the load balancer uses QUIC when
      possible. - When quic-override is set to DISABLE, the load balancer
      doesn't use QUIC. - If the quic-override flag is not specified, NONE is
      implied.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional
      TargetHttpsProxy resides. This field is not applicable to global
      TargetHttpsProxies.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    selfLinkWithId: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource with
      the resource id.
    serverTlsPolicy: Optional. A URL referring to a
      networksecurity.ServerTlsPolicy resource that describes how the proxy
      should authenticate inbound traffic. serverTlsPolicy only applies to a
      global TargetHttpsProxy attached to globalForwardingRules with the
      loadBalancingScheme set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. If left blank,
      communications are not encrypted. Note: This field currently has no
      impact.
    sslCertificates: URLs to SslCertificate resources that are used to
      authenticate connections between users and the load balancer. At least
      one SSL certificate must be specified. Currently, you may specify up to
      15 SSL certificates. sslCertificates do not apply when the load
      balancing scheme is set to INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
    sslPolicy: URL of SslPolicy resource that will be associated with the
      TargetHttpsProxy resource. If not set, the TargetHttpsProxy resource has
      no SSL policy configured.
    urlMap: A fully-qualified or valid partial URL to the UrlMap resource that
      defines the mapping from URL to the BackendService. For example, the
      following are all valid URLs for specifying a URL map: -
      https://www.googleapis.compute/v1/projects/project/global/urlMaps/ url-

      is defined by the server.
    instance: A URL to the virtual machine instance that handles traffic for
      this target instance. When creating a target instance, you can provide
      the fully-qualified URL or a valid partial URL to the desired virtual
      machine. For example, the following are all valid URLs: -

      traffic. If not specified, the traffic will be forwarded to the network
      that the default network interface belongs to.

  Enums:
    SessionAffinityValueValuesEnum: Session affinity option, must be one of
      the following values: NONE: Connections from the same client IP may go
      to any instance in the pool. CLIENT_IP: Connections from the same client
      IP will go to the same instance in the pool while that instance remains
      healthy. CLIENT_IP_PROTO: Connections from the same client IP with the
      same IP protocol will go to the same instance in the pool while that
      instance remains healthy.

  Fields:
    backupPool: The server-defined URL for the resource. This field is
      applicable only when the containing target pool is serving a forwarding
      rule as the primary pool, and its failoverRatio field is properly set to
      a value between [0, 1]. backupPool and failoverRatio together define the
      fallback behavior of the primary target pool: if the ratio of the
      healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below failoverRatio,
      traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup
      pool. In case where failoverRatio and backupPool are not set, or all the
      instances in the backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed
      back to the primary pool in the "force" mode, where traffic will be
      spread to the healthy instances with the best effort, or to all
      instances when no instance is healthy.
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    failoverRatio: This field is applicable only when the containing target
      pool is serving a forwarding rule as the primary pool (i.e., not as a
      backup pool to some other target pool). The value of the field must be
      in [0, 1]. If set, backupPool must also be set. They together define the
      fallback behavior of the primary target pool: if the ratio of the
      healthy instances in the primary pool is at or below this number,
      traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP will be directed to the backup
      pool. In case where failoverRatio is not set or all the instances in the
      backup pool are unhealthy, the traffic will be directed back to the
      primary pool in the "force" mode, where traffic will be spread to the
      healthy instances with the best effort, or to all instances when no
      instance is healthy.
    healthChecks: The URL of the HttpHealthCheck resource. A member instance
      in this pool is considered healthy if and only if the health checks
      pass. Only legacy HttpHealthChecks are supported. Only one health check
      may be specified.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    instances: A list of resource URLs to the virtual machine instances

      as this pool.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#targetPool for
      target pools.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the target pool resides.

      associated with this target pool.

    selfLinkWithId: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for this resource with
      the resource id.

      in the pool. CLIENT_IP: Connections from the same client IP will go to

  * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/urlMaps) *
  [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/alpha/regionUrlMaps) A URL map
  resource is a component of certain types of cloud load balancers and Traffic
  Director: * urlMaps are used by external HTTP(S) load balancers and Traffic
  Director. * regionUrlMaps are used by internal HTTP(S) load balancers. For a
  list of supported URL map features by the load balancer type, see the Load
  balancing features: Routing and traffic management table. For a list of
  supported URL map features for Traffic Director, see the Traffic Director
  features: Routing and traffic management table. This resource defines
  mappings from hostnames and URL paths to either a backend service or a
  backend bucket. To use the global urlMaps resource, the backend service must
  have a loadBalancingScheme of either EXTERNAL or INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED. To
  use the regionUrlMaps resource, the backend service must have a
  loadBalancingScheme of INTERNAL_MANAGED. For more information, read URL Map
  Concepts.

  Fields:
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy: defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy
      specifies how the Load Balancer returns error responses when
      BackendServiceor BackendBucket responds with an error. This policy takes
      effect at the Load Balancer level and applies only when no policy has
      been defined for the error code at lower levels like PathMatcher,
      RouteRule and PathRule within this UrlMap. For example, consider a
      UrlMap with the following configuration: -
      defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy containing policies for responding to
      5xx and 4xx errors - A PathMatcher configured for *.example.com has
      defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy for 4xx. If a request for
      http://www.example.com/ encounters a 404, the policy in
      pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be enforced. When the
      request for http://www.example.com/ encounters a 502, the policy in
      UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be enforced. When a request
      that does not match any host in *.example.com such as
      http://www.myotherexample.com/, encounters a 404,
      UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. When used in
      conjunction with defaultRouteAction.retryPolicy, retries take
      precedence. Only once all retries are exhausted, the
      defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a retry,
      if load balancer is successful in reaching the service, the
      defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from the
      service is returned to the client. defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is
      supported only for Global External HTTP(S) load balancing.
    defaultRouteAction: defaultRouteAction takes effect when none of the
      hostRules match. The load balancer performs advanced routing actions,
      such as URL rewrites and header transformations, before forwarding the
      request to the selected backend. If defaultRouteAction specifies any
      weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be set. Conversely if
      defaultService is set, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any
      weightedBackendServices. Only one of defaultRouteAction or
      defaultUrlRedirect must be set. URL maps for Classic external HTTP(S)
      load balancers only support the urlRewrite action within
      defaultRouteAction. defaultRouteAction has no effect when the URL map is
      bound to a target gRPC proxy that has the validateForProxyless field set
      to true.
    defaultService: The full or partial URL of the defaultService resource to
      which traffic is directed if none of the hostRules match. If
      defaultRouteAction is also specified, advanced routing actions, such as
      URL rewrites, take effect before sending the request to the backend.
      However, if defaultService is specified, defaultRouteAction cannot
      contain any weightedBackendServices. Conversely, if routeAction
      specifies any weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified.
      Only one of defaultService, defaultUrlRedirect , or
      defaultRouteAction.weightedBackendService must be set. defaultService
      has no effect when the URL map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has
      the validateForProxyless field set to true.
    defaultUrlRedirect: When none of the specified hostRules match, the
      request is redirected to a URL specified by defaultUrlRedirect. If
      defaultUrlRedirect is specified, defaultService or defaultRouteAction
      must not be set. Not supported when the URL map is bound to a target
      gRPC proxy.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    fingerprint: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored
      in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking. This field is
      ignored when inserting a UrlMap. An up-to-date fingerprint must be
      provided in order to update the UrlMap, otherwise the request will fail
      with error 412 conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a
      get() request to retrieve a UrlMap.
    headerAction: Specifies changes to request and response headers that need
      to take effect for the selected backendService. The headerAction
      specified here take effect after headerAction specified under
      pathMatcher. headerAction is not supported for load balancers that have
      their loadBalancingScheme set to EXTERNAL. Not supported when the URL
      map is bound to a target gRPC proxy that has validateForProxyless field
      set to true.
    hostRules: The list of host rules to use against the URL.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of the resource. Always compute#urlMaps for url
      maps.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    pathMatchers: The list of named PathMatchers to use against the URL.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the regional URL map
      resides. This field is not applicable to global URL maps. You must
      specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not settable
      as a field in the request body.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    tests: The list of expected URL mapping tests. Request to update the

    LabelsValue: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified
      by the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.

  Fields:
    creationTimestamp: [Output Only] Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text
      format.
    description: An optional description of this resource. Provide this
      property when you create the resource.
    detailedStatus: [Output Only] Detailed status message for the VPN tunnel.
    id: [Output Only] The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier
      is defined by the server.
    ikeVersion: IKE protocol version to use when establishing the VPN tunnel
      with the peer VPN gateway. Acceptable IKE versions are 1 or 2. The
      default version is 2.
    kind: [Output Only] Type of resource. Always compute#vpnTunnel for VPN
      tunnels.
    labelFingerprint: A fingerprint for the labels being applied to this
      VpnTunnel, which is essentially a hash of the labels set used for
      optimistic locking. The fingerprint is initially generated by Compute
      Engine and changes after every request to modify or update labels. You
      must always provide an up-to-date fingerprint hash in order to update or
      change labels, otherwise the request will fail with error 412
      conditionNotMet. To see the latest fingerprint, make a get() request to
      retrieve a VpnTunnel.
    labels: Labels for this resource. These can only be added or modified by
      the setLabels method. Each label key/value pair must comply with
      RFC1035. Label values may be empty.
    localTrafficSelector: Local traffic selector to use when establishing the
      VPN tunnel with the peer VPN gateway. The value should be a CIDR
      formatted string, for example: 192.168.0.0/16. The ranges must be
      disjoint. Only IPv4 is supported.
    name: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is
      created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.
      Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the
      regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first
      character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must
      be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which
      cannot be a dash.
    peerExternalGateway: URL of the peer side external VPN gateway to which
      this VPN tunnel is connected. Provided by the client when the VPN tunnel
      is created. This field is exclusive with the field peerGcpGateway.
    peerExternalGatewayInterface: The interface ID of the external VPN gateway
      to which this VPN tunnel is connected. Provided by the client when the
      VPN tunnel is created. Possible values are: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`. The
      number of IDs in use depends on the external VPN gateway redundancy
      type.
    peerGcpGateway: URL of the peer side HA GCP VPN gateway to which this VPN
      tunnel is connected. Provided by the client when the VPN tunnel is
      created. This field can be used when creating highly available VPN from

      peerExternalGateway. If provided, the VPN tunnel will automatically use
      the same vpnGatewayInterface ID in the peer GCP VPN gateway.
    peerIp: IP address of the peer VPN gateway. Only IPv4 is supported.
    region: [Output Only] URL of the region where the VPN tunnel resides. You
      must specify this field as part of the HTTP request URL. It is not
      settable as a field in the request body.
    remoteTrafficSelector: Remote traffic selectors to use when establishing
      the VPN tunnel with the peer VPN gateway. The value should be a CIDR
      formatted string, for example: 192.168.0.0/16. The ranges should be
      disjoint. Only IPv4 is supported.
    router: URL of the router resource to be used for dynamic routing.
    selfLink: [Output Only] Server-defined URL for the resource.
    sharedSecret: Shared secret used to set the secure session between the
      Cloud VPN gateway and the peer VPN gateway.
    sharedSecretHash: Hash of the shared secret.
    status: [Output Only] The status of the VPN tunnel, which can be one of
      the following: - PROVISIONING: Resource is being allocated for the VPN
      tunnel. - WAITING_FOR_FULL_CONFIG: Waiting to receive all VPN-related
      configs from the user. Network, TargetVpnGateway, VpnTunnel,
      ForwardingRule, and Route resources are needed to setup the VPN tunnel.
