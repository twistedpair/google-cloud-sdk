      the specified resource. This field does _not_ indicate whether the
      member actually has the permission for the resource. There might be
      another binding that overrides this binding. To determine whether the
      member actually has the permission, use the `access` field in the
      TroubleshootIamPolicyResponse.

    RolePermissionRelevanceValueValuesEnum: The relevance of the permission's
      existence, or nonexistence, in the role to the overall determination for

  Messages:
    MembershipsValue: Indicates whether each member in the binding includes
      the member specified in the request, either directly or indirectly. Each
      key identifies a member in the binding, and each value indicates whether
      the member in the binding includes the member in the request. For
      example, suppose that a binding includes the following members: *
      `user:alice@example.com` * `group:product-eng@example.com` You want to
      troubleshoot access for `user:bob@example.com`. This user is a member of

      in the value is set to `NOT_INCLUDED`. For the second member in the
      binding, the key is `group:product-eng@example.com`, and the
      `membership` field in the value is set to `INCLUDED`.

  Fields:
    allowAccessState: Required. Indicates whether _this binding_ provides the

      permission for the resource. There might be another binding that
      overrides this binding. To determine whether the member actually has the
      permission, use the `access` field in the TroubleshootIamPolicyResponse.
    combinedMembership: The combined result of all memberships. Indicates if
      there is any member in the binding includes the principal specified in
      the request, either directly or indirectly.

      expression evaluates to `true`. To learn about IAM Conditions, see
      https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/overview.
    conditionExplanation: Condition evaluation state for this binding.
    memberships: Indicates whether each member in the binding includes the
      member specified in the request, either directly or indirectly. Each key
      identifies a member in the binding, and each value indicates whether the
      member in the binding includes the member in the request. For example,
      suppose that a binding includes the following members: *
      `user:alice@example.com` * `group:product-eng@example.com` You want to

  version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    rules: If more than one rule is specified, the rules are applied in the
      following manner: - All matching LOG rules are always applied. - If any
      DENY/DENY_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is denied. Logging will be
      applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. - Otherwise, if
      any ALLOW/ALLOW_WITH_LOG rule matches, permission is granted. Logging
      will be applied if one or more matching rule requires logging. -
      Otherwise, if no rule applies, permission is denied.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).

      Each deny rule is evaluated independently. If this deny rule does not

      `{service_fqdn}/{resource}.{verb}`, where `{service_fqdn}` is the fully
      qualified domain name for the service. For example,
      `iam.googleapis.com/roles.list`.

      Google Account that was deleted recently. For example,
      `deleted:principal://goog/subject/alice@example.com?uid=1234567890`. If
      the Google Account is recovered, this identifier reverts to the standard
      identifier for a Google Account. *
      `principalSet://goog/group/{group_id}`: A Google group. For example,
      `principalSet://goog/group/admins@example.com`. *

      identifier for a Google group. * `principal://iam.googleapis.com/project
      s/-/serviceAccounts/{service_account_id}`: A Google Cloud service
      account. For example,
      `principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/my-service-
      account@iam.gserviceaccount.com`. * `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.
      com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/{service_account_id}?uid={uid}`: A Google

    exceptionPermissions: Specifies the permissions that this rule excludes
      from the set of denied permissions given by `denied_permissions`. If a
      permission appears in `denied_permissions` _and_ in
      `exception_permissions` then it will _not_ be denied. The excluded

      `denied_permissions`.
