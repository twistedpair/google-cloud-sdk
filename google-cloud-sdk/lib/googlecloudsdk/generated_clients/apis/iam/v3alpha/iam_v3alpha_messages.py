      request. If the condition evaluates to `false`, then this binding does
      not apply to the current request. However, a different role binding

      binding. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM
      policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).
    members: Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud
      resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A
      special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with
      or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special
      identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google
      account or a service account. Does not include identities that come from
      external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation. *

      account. For example, `alice@example.com` . *

      "activationConditions": { "iam.googleapis.com": { "cel_condition": } }
      Each rule is evaluated independently. If this rule does not apply to a

      `eventarc.googleapis.com`
    description: Optional. Customer specified description of the rule. Must be
      less than or equal to 256 characters.
    effect: Required. The effect of the rule.
    excludedPermissions: Optional. Specifies the permissions that this rule
      excludes from the set of affected permissions given by `permissions`. If
      a permission appears in `permissions` _and_ in `excluded_permissions`
      then it will _not_ be subject to the policy effect. The excluded
      permissions can be specified using the same syntax as `permissions`.
    excludedPrincipals: Optional. The identities that are excluded from the
      access policy rule, even if they are listed in the `principals`. For
      example, you could add a Google group to the `principals`, then exclude
      specific users who belong to that group.
    permissions: Required. The permissions that are explicitly affected by
      this rule. Each permission uses the format
      `{service_fqdn}/{resource}.{verb}`, where `{service_fqdn}` is the fully
      qualified domain name for the service. Currently supported permissions
      are: * `eventarc.googleapis.com/messageBuses.publish`.
    principals: Required. The identities for which this rule's effect governs
      using one or more permissions on Google Cloud resources. This field can
      contain the following values: * `principal://goog/subject/{email_id}`: A
      specific Google Account. Includes Gmail, Cloud Identity, and Google
      Workspace user accounts. For example,
      `principal://goog/subject/alice@example.com`. * `principal://iam.googlea
      pis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/{service_account_id}`: A Google Cloud
      service account. For example,
      `principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/my-service-
      account@iam.gserviceaccount.com`. *
      `principalSet://goog/group/{group_id}`: A Google group. For example,
      `principalSet://goog/group/admins@example.com`. *
      `principalSet://goog/cloudIdentityCustomerId/{customer_id}`: All of the
      principals associated with the specified Google Workspace or Cloud
      Identity customer ID. For example,
      `principalSet://goog/cloudIdentityCustomerId/C01Abc35`. If an identifier
      that was previously set on a policy is soft deleted, then calls to read
      that policy will return the identifier with a deleted prefix. Users
      cannot set identifiers with this syntax. *
      `deleted:principal://goog/subject/{email_id}?uid={uid}`: A specific
      Google Account that was deleted recently. For example,
      `deleted:principal://goog/subject/alice@example.com?uid=1234567890`. If
      the Google Account is recovered, this identifier reverts to the standard
      identifier for a Google Account. *
      `deleted:principalSet://goog/group/{group_id}?uid={uid}`: A Google group
      that was deleted recently. For example,
      `deleted:principalSet://goog/group/admins@example.com?uid=1234567890`.
      If the Google group is restored, this identifier reverts to the standard
      identifier for a Google group. * `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com
      /projects/-/serviceAccounts/{service_account_id}?uid={uid}`: A Google
      Cloud service account that was deleted recently. For example,
      `deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/-/serviceAccounts/my-

class IamProjectsLocationsPolicyPortersTranslationsTranslatedPoliciesPatchRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A
  IamProjectsLocationsPolicyPortersTranslationsTranslatedPoliciesPatchRequest
  object.

  Fields:
    googleIamV3alphaTranslatedPolicy: A GoogleIamV3alphaTranslatedPolicy
      resource to be passed as the request body.
    name: Identifier. Name of resource. Format: projects/{project}/locations/{
      location}/policyPorters/{policy_porter}/translations/{translation}/trans
      latedPolicies/{translated_policy}.
    requestId: Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify
      a unique request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server
      will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The
      server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes since the first
      request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial
      request and the request times out. If you make the request again with
      the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the
      same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request.
      This prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments.
      The request ID must be a valid UUID with the exception that zero UUID is
      not supported (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000).
    updateMask: Required. Field mask is used to specify the fields to be
      overwritten in the TranslatedPolicy resource by the update. The fields
      specified in the update_mask are relative to the resource, not the full
      request. A field will be overwritten if it is in the mask. If the user
      does not provide a mask then all fields will be overwritten.

  Fields:
    filter: Optional. Filtering currently only supports the kind of policies
      to return, and must be in the format "kind:[policyKind1] OR
      kind:[policyKind2]". New policy kinds may be added in the future without
      notice. Example value: "kind:principalAccessBoundaryPolicies"
    pageSize: Optional. The limit of number of items (binding+policy pairs) to
      return. The default and maximum is 100 and values above 100 are
      truncated to 100.
    pageToken: Optional. A page token, received from a previous
      `SearchApplicablePolicies` call.
    targetQuery: Required. The target for which to list the policies and
      bindings for. Binding conditions will not be evaluated and all bindings
      that are bound to the target will be returned. All targets from the
      PolicyBinding are supported, as well as principals that are part of the
      principalSet. For example: *
      `//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/organizations/ORGANIZATION_ID` *
