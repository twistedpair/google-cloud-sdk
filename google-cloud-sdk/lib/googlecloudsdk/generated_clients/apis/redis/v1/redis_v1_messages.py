      beyond the first 2 will be placed in zones selected by the service.
    authEnabled: Optional. Indicates whether OSS Redis AUTH is enabled for the
      instance. If set to "true" AUTH is enabled on the instance. Default
      value is "false" meaning AUTH is disabled.

    createTime: Output only. The time the instance was created.
    currentLocationId: Output only. The current zone where the Redis primary
      node is located. In basic tier, this will always be the same as

      for the instance. For standard tier, additional nodes will be added
      across multiple zones for protection against zonal failures. If
      specified, at least one node will be provisioned in this zone.

      project and location using the form:
      `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}`
      Note: Redis instances are managed and addressed at regional level so
      location_id here refers to a GCP region; however, users may choose which
      specific zone (or collection of zones for cross-zone instances) an
      instance should be provisioned in. Refer to location_id and
      alternative_location_id fields for more details.

    readEndpoint: Output only. Hostname or IP address of the exposed readonly
      Redis endpoint. Standard tier only. Targets all healthy replica nodes in
      instance. Replication is asynchronous and replica nodes will exhibit
      some lag behind the primary. Write requests must target 'host'.
    readEndpointPort: Output only. The port number of the exposed readonly
      redis endpoint. Standard tier only. Write requests should target 'port'.
    readReplicasMode: Optional. Read replicas mode for the instance. Defaults
