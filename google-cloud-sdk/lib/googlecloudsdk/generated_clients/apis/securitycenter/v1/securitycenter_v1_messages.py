class Access(_messages.Message):
  r"""Represents an access event.

  Fields:
    callerIp: Caller's IP address, such as "1.1.1.1".
    callerIpGeo: The caller IP's geolocation, which identifies where the call
      came from.
    methodName: The method that the service account called, e.g.
      "SetIamPolicy".
    principalEmail: Associated email, such as "foo@google.com". The email
      address of the authenticated user or a service account acting on behalf
      of a third party principal making the request. For third party identity
      callers, the `principal_subject` field is populated instead of this
      field. For privacy reasons, the principal email address is sometimes
      redacted. For more information, see [Caller identities in audit
      logs](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit#user-id).
    principalSubject: A string that represents the principal_subject that is
      associated with the identity. Unlike `principal_email`,
      `principal_subject` supports principals that aren't associated with
      email addresses, such as third party principals. For most identities,
      the format is `principal://iam.googleapis.com/{identity pool
      name}/subject/{subject}`. Some GKE identities, such as GKE_WORKLOAD,
      FREEFORM, and GKE_HUB_WORKLOAD, still use the legacy format
      `serviceAccount:{identity pool name}[{subject}]`.
    serviceAccountDelegationInfo: The identity delegation history of an
      authenticated service account that made the request. The
      `serviceAccountDelegationInfo[]` object contains information about the
      real authorities that try to access Google Cloud resources by delegating
      on a service account. When multiple authorities are present, they are
      guaranteed to be sorted based on the original ordering of the identity
      delegation events.
    serviceAccountKeyName: The name of the service account key that was used
      to create or exchange credentials when authenticating the service
      account that made the request. This is a scheme-less URI full resource
      name. For example: "//iam.googleapis.com/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/serviceAc
      counts/{ACCOUNT}/keys/{key}".
    serviceName: This is the API service that the service account made a call
      to, e.g. "iam.googleapis.com"
    userAgent: The caller's user agent string associated with the finding.
    userAgentFamily: Type of user agent associated with the finding. For
      example, an operating system shell or an embedded or standalone
      application.
    userName: A string that represents a username. The username provided
      depends on the type of the finding and is likely not an IAM principal.
      For example, this can be a system username if the finding is related to
      a virtual machine, or it can be an application login username.

        by an external actor, exploitable, and results in the direct ability
        to execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain
        additional access and privileges to cloud resources and workloads.
        Examples include publicly accessible unprotected user data and public
        SSH access with weak or no passwords. Threat: Indicates a threat that
        is able to access, modify, or delete data or execute unauthorized code
        within existing resources.
      HIGH: Vulnerability: A high risk vulnerability can be easily discovered
        and exploited in combination with other vulnerabilities in order to
        gain direct access and the ability to execute arbitrary code,
        exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain additional access and privileges
        to cloud resources and workloads. An example is a database with weak
        or no passwords that is only accessible internally. This database
        could easily be compromised by an actor that had access to the
        internal network. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able to create
        new computational resources in an environment but not able to access
        data or execute code in existing resources.
      MEDIUM: Vulnerability: A medium risk vulnerability could be used by an
        actor to gain access to resources or privileges that enable them to
        eventually (through multiple steps or a complex exploit) gain access
        and the ability to execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate data. An
        example is a service account with access to more projects than it
        should have. If an actor gains access to the service account, they
        could potentially use that access to manipulate a project the service
        account was not intended to. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able
        to cause operational impact but may not access data or execute
        unauthorized code.
      LOW: Vulnerability: A low risk vulnerability hampers a security
        organization's ability to detect vulnerabilities or active threats in
        their deployment, or prevents the root cause investigation of security
        issues. An example is monitoring and logs being disabled for resource
        configurations and access. Threat: Indicates a threat that has

      "SetIamPolicy".
    principalEmail: Associated email, such as "foo@google.com". The email

    Values:

        doesn't write a severity value.
      CRITICAL: Vulnerability: A critical vulnerability is easily discoverable
        by an external actor, exploitable, and results in the direct ability
        to execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain
        additional access and privileges to cloud resources and workloads.
        Examples include publicly accessible unprotected user data and public
        SSH access with weak or no passwords. Threat: Indicates a threat that
        is able to access, modify, or delete data or execute unauthorized code
        within existing resources.
      HIGH: Vulnerability: A high risk vulnerability can be easily discovered
        and exploited in combination with other vulnerabilities in order to
        gain direct access and the ability to execute arbitrary code,
        exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain additional access and privileges
        to cloud resources and workloads. An example is a database with weak
        or no passwords that is only accessible internally. This database
        could easily be compromised by an actor that had access to the
        internal network. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able to create
        new computational resources in an environment but not able to access
        data or execute code in existing resources.
      MEDIUM: Vulnerability: A medium risk vulnerability could be used by an
        actor to gain access to resources or privileges that enable them to
        eventually (through multiple steps or a complex exploit) gain access
        and the ability to execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate data. An
        example is a service account with access to more projects than it
        should have. If an actor gains access to the service account, they
        could potentially use that access to manipulate a project the service
        account was not intended to. Threat: Indicates a threat that is able
        to cause operational impact but may not access data or execute
        unauthorized code.
      LOW: Vulnerability: A low risk vulnerability hampers a security
        organization's ability to detect vulnerabilities or active threats in
        their deployment, or prevents the root cause investigation of security
        issues. An example is monitoring and logs being disabled for resource
        configurations and access. Threat: Indicates a threat that has
        obtained minimal access to an environment but is not able to access
        data, execute code, or create resources.

      - compare_duration) and read_time. The state change value is derived
      based on the presence of the asset at the two points in time.
      Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the

      not present at the start of compare_duration, but present at
      reference_time. * "REMOVED": indicates that the asset was present at the

      "ACTIVE": indicates that the asset was present at both the start and the
      end of the time period defined by compare_duration and reference_time.
      If compare_duration is not specified, then the only possible
      state_change is "UNUSED", which will be the state_change set for all
      assets present at read_time. If this field is set then `state_change`
      must be a specified field in `group_by`.
    filter: Expression that defines the filter to apply across assets. The
      expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via logical
      operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher

      character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields map to those
      defined in the Asset resource. Examples include: * name *
      security_center_properties.resource_name *
      resource_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The
      supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `>`, `<`, `>=`,
      `<=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.
      The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer
      literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without
      quotes. The following field and operator combinations are supported: *
      name: `=` * update_time: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be

  Fields:
    compareDuration: When compare_duration is set, the GroupResult's
      "state_change" attribute is updated to indicate whether the finding had
      its state changed, the finding's state remained unchanged, or if the
      finding was added during the compare_duration period of time that
      precedes the read_time. This is the time between (read_time -
      compare_duration) and read_time. The state_change value is derived based
      on the presence and state of the finding at the two points in time.
      Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the
      result. For example, the results aren't affected if the finding is made
      inactive and then active again. Possible "state_change" values when
      compare_duration is specified: * "CHANGED": indicates that the finding
      was present and matched the given filter at the start of
      compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time. * "UNCHANGED":
      indicates that the finding was present and matched the given filter at
      the start of compare_duration and did not change state at read_time. *
      "ADDED": indicates that the finding did not match the given filter or
      was not present at the start of compare_duration, but was present at
      read_time. * "REMOVED": indicates that the finding was present and
      matched the filter at the start of compare_duration, but did not match
      the filter at read_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the
      only possible state_change is "UNUSED", which will be the state_change
      set for all findings present at read_time. If this field is set then
      `state_change` must be a specified field in `group_by`.
    filter: Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings. The
      expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical
      operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher
      precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-`
      character in front of them to indicate negation. Examples include: *
      name * source_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The
      supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `>`, `<`, `>=`,
      `<=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.
      The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer
      literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without
      quotes. The following field and operator combinations are supported: *
      name: `=` * parent: `=`, `:` * resource_name: `=`, `:` * state: `=`, `:`
      * category: `=`, `:` * external_uri: `=`, `:` * event_time: `=`, `>`,
      `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an
      RFC3339 string. Examples: `event_time = "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"`
      `event_time = 1560208038000` * severity: `=`, `:` * workflow_state: `=`,
      `:` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` * source_properties: `=`, `:`, `>`,
      `<`, `>=`, `<=` For example, `source_properties.size = 100` is a valid
      filter string. Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based
      on a property existing: `source_properties.my_property : ""` Use a
      negated partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property
      not existing: `-source_properties.my_property : ""` * resource: *
      resource.name: `=`, `:` * resource.parent_name: `=`, `:` *

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -
  user:eve@example.com role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
  condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after
  Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')
  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).

class SecuritycenterFoldersAssetsListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A SecuritycenterFoldersAssetsListRequest object.

  Fields:
    compareDuration: When compare_duration is set, the ListAssetsResult's
      "state_change" attribute is updated to indicate whether the asset was
      added, removed, or remained present during the compare_duration period
      of time that precedes the read_time. This is the time between (read_time
      - compare_duration) and read_time. The state_change value is derived
      based on the presence of the asset at the two points in time.
      Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the
      result. For example, the results aren't affected if the asset is removed
      and re-created again. Possible "state_change" values when
      compare_duration is specified: * "ADDED": indicates that the asset was
      not present at the start of compare_duration, but present at read_time.
      * "REMOVED": indicates that the asset was present at the start of
      compare_duration, but not present at read_time. * "ACTIVE": indicates
      that the asset was present at both the start and the end of the time
      period defined by compare_duration and read_time. If compare_duration is
      not specified, then the only possible state_change is "UNUSED", which
      will be the state_change set for all assets present at read_time.
    fieldMask: A field mask to specify the ListAssetsResult fields to be
      listed in the response. An empty field mask will list all fields.
    filter: Expression that defines the filter to apply across assets. The
      expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via logical
      operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher
      precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-`
      character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields map to those
      defined in the Asset resource. Examples include: * name *
      security_center_properties.resource_name *
      resource_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The
      supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `>`, `<`, `>=`,
      `<=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.
      The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer
      literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without
      quotes. The following are the allowed field and operator combinations: *
      name: `=` * update_time: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be
      milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `update_time =
      "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"` `update_time = 1560208038000` *
      create_time: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be
      milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `create_time =
      "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"` `create_time = 1560208038000` *
      iam_policy.policy_blob: `=`, `:` * resource_properties: `=`, `:`, `>`,
      `<`, `>=`, `<=` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_name: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_display_name: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_type: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_parent: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_parent_display_name: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_project: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_project_display_name: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_owners: `=`, `:` For example,
      `resource_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string. Use a partial
      match on the empty string to filter based on a property existing:
      `resource_properties.my_property : ""` Use a negated partial match on
      the empty string to filter based on a property not existing:
      `-resource_properties.my_property : ""`
    orderBy: Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting.
      The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of
      fields. For example: "name,resource_properties.a_property". The default
      sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a
      suffix " desc" should be appended to the field name. For example: "name
      desc,resource_properties.a_property". Redundant space characters in the
      syntax are insignificant. "name desc,resource_properties.a_property" and
      " name desc , resource_properties.a_property " are equivalent. The
      following fields are supported: name update_time resource_properties
      security_marks.marks security_center_properties.resource_name
      security_center_properties.resource_display_name
      security_center_properties.resource_parent
      security_center_properties.resource_parent_display_name
      security_center_properties.resource_project
      security_center_properties.resource_project_display_name
      security_center_properties.resource_type
    pageSize: The maximum number of results to return in a single response.
      Default is 10, minimum is 1, maximum is 1000.
    pageToken: The value returned by the last `ListAssetsResponse`; indicates
      that this is a continuation of a prior `ListAssets` call, and that the
      system should return the next page of data.
    parent: Required. The name of the parent resource that contains the
      assets. The value that you can specify on parent depends on the method
      in which you specify parent. You can specify one of the following
      values: `organizations/[organization_id]`, `folders/[folder_id]`, or
      `projects/[project_id]`.
    readTime: Time used as a reference point when filtering assets. The filter
      is limited to assets existing at the supplied time and their values are
      those at that specific time. Absence of this field will default to the
      API's version of NOW.

  r"""A SecuritycenterFoldersSourcesFindingsListRequest object.

  Fields:
    compareDuration: When compare_duration is set, the ListFindingsResult's
      "state_change" attribute is updated to indicate whether the finding had
      its state changed, the finding's state remained unchanged, or if the
      finding was added in any state during the compare_duration period of
      time that precedes the read_time. This is the time between (read_time -
      compare_duration) and read_time. The state_change value is derived based
      on the presence and state of the finding at the two points in time.
      Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the
      result. For example, the results aren't affected if the finding is made
      inactive and then active again. Possible "state_change" values when
      compare_duration is specified: * "CHANGED": indicates that the finding
      was present and matched the given filter at the start of
      compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time. * "UNCHANGED":
      indicates that the finding was present and matched the given filter at
      the start of compare_duration and did not change state at read_time. *
      "ADDED": indicates that the finding did not match the given filter or
      was not present at the start of compare_duration, but was present at
      read_time. * "REMOVED": indicates that the finding was present and
      matched the filter at the start of compare_duration, but did not match
      the filter at read_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the
      only possible state_change is "UNUSED", which will be the state_change
      set for all findings present at read_time.
    fieldMask: A field mask to specify the Finding fields to be listed in the
      response. An empty field mask will list all fields.
    filter: Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings. The
      expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical
      operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher
      precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-`
      character in front of them to indicate negation. Examples include: *
      name * source_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The
      supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `>`, `<`, `>=`,
      `<=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.
      The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer
      literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without
      quotes. The following field and operator combinations are supported: *
      name: `=` * parent: `=`, `:` * resource_name: `=`, `:` * state: `=`, `:`
      * category: `=`, `:` * external_uri: `=`, `:` * event_time: `=`, `>`,
      `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an
      RFC3339 string. Examples: `event_time = "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"`
      `event_time = 1560208038000` * severity: `=`, `:` * workflow_state: `=`,
      `:` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` * source_properties: `=`, `:`, `>`,
      `<`, `>=`, `<=` For example, `source_properties.size = 100` is a valid
      filter string. Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based
      on a property existing: `source_properties.my_property : ""` Use a
      negated partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property
      not existing: `-source_properties.my_property : ""` * resource: *
      resource.name: `=`, `:` * resource.parent_name: `=`, `:` *
      resource.parent_display_name: `=`, `:` * resource.project_name: `=`, `:`

      resource.folders.resource_folder: `=`, `:` * resource.display_name: `=`,
      `:`
    orderBy: Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting.
      The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of
      fields. For example: "name,resource_properties.a_property". The default
      sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a
      suffix " desc" should be appended to the field name. For example: "name
      desc,source_properties.a_property". Redundant space characters in the
      syntax are insignificant. "name desc,source_properties.a_property" and "
      name desc , source_properties.a_property " are equivalent. The following
      fields are supported: name parent state category resource_name
      event_time source_properties security_marks.marks
    pageSize: The maximum number of results to return in a single response.
      Default is 10, minimum is 1, maximum is 1000.
    pageToken: The value returned by the last `ListFindingsResponse`;
      indicates that this is a continuation of a prior `ListFindings` call,
      and that the system should return the next page of data.
    parent: Required. Name of the source the findings belong to. Its format is
      `organizations/[organization_id]/sources/[source_id]`,
      `folders/[folder_id]/sources/[source_id]`, or

      provide a source_id of `-`. For example:
      `organizations/{organization_id}/sources/-`,
      `folders/{folder_id}/sources/-` or `projects/{projects_id}/sources/-`
    readTime: Time used as a reference point when filtering findings. The
      filter is limited to findings existing at the supplied time and their
      values are those at that specific time. Absence of this field will
      default to the API's version of NOW.

      not specified, then the only possible state_change is "UNUSED", which
      will be the state_change set for all assets present at read_time.
    fieldMask: A field mask to specify the ListAssetsResult fields to be
      listed in the response. An empty field mask will list all fields.
    filter: Expression that defines the filter to apply across assets. The
      expression is a list of zero or more restrictions combined via logical
      operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher
      precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-`
      character in front of them to indicate negation. The fields map to those
      defined in the Asset resource. Examples include: * name *
      security_center_properties.resource_name *
      resource_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The
      supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `>`, `<`, `>=`,
      `<=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.
      The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer
      literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without
      quotes. The following are the allowed field and operator combinations: *
      name: `=` * update_time: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be
      milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `update_time =
      "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"` `update_time = 1560208038000` *
      create_time: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be
      milliseconds since epoch or an RFC3339 string. Examples: `create_time =
      "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"` `create_time = 1560208038000` *
      iam_policy.policy_blob: `=`, `:` * resource_properties: `=`, `:`, `>`,
      `<`, `>=`, `<=` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_name: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_display_name: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_type: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_parent: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_parent_display_name: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_project: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_project_display_name: `=`, `:` *
      security_center_properties.resource_owners: `=`, `:` For example,
      `resource_properties.size = 100` is a valid filter string. Use a partial
      match on the empty string to filter based on a property existing:
      `resource_properties.my_property : ""` Use a negated partial match on
      the empty string to filter based on a property not existing:
      `-resource_properties.my_property : ""`
    orderBy: Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting.
      The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of
      fields. For example: "name,resource_properties.a_property". The default
      sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a
      suffix " desc" should be appended to the field name. For example: "name
      desc,resource_properties.a_property". Redundant space characters in the
      syntax are insignificant. "name desc,resource_properties.a_property" and
      " name desc , resource_properties.a_property " are equivalent. The
      following fields are supported: name update_time resource_properties
      security_marks.marks security_center_properties.resource_name
      security_center_properties.resource_display_name
      security_center_properties.resource_parent
      security_center_properties.resource_parent_display_name
      security_center_properties.resource_project
      security_center_properties.resource_project_display_name
      security_center_properties.resource_type

    parent: Required. The name of the parent resource that contains the
      assets. The value that you can specify on parent depends on the method
      in which you specify parent. You can specify one of the following
      values: `organizations/[organization_id]`, `folders/[folder_id]`, or
      `projects/[project_id]`.
    readTime: Time used as a reference point when filtering assets. The filter
      is limited to assets existing at the supplied time and their values are
      those at that specific time. Absence of this field will default to the
      API's version of NOW.

  Fields:
    compareDuration: When compare_duration is set, the ListFindingsResult's
      "state_change" attribute is updated to indicate whether the finding had
      its state changed, the finding's state remained unchanged, or if the
      finding was added in any state during the compare_duration period of
      time that precedes the read_time. This is the time between (read_time -
      compare_duration) and read_time. The state_change value is derived based
      on the presence and state of the finding at the two points in time.
      Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the
      result. For example, the results aren't affected if the finding is made
      inactive and then active again. Possible "state_change" values when
      compare_duration is specified: * "CHANGED": indicates that the finding
      was present and matched the given filter at the start of
      compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time. * "UNCHANGED":
      indicates that the finding was present and matched the given filter at
      the start of compare_duration and did not change state at read_time. *
      "ADDED": indicates that the finding did not match the given filter or
      was not present at the start of compare_duration, but was present at
      read_time. * "REMOVED": indicates that the finding was present and
      matched the filter at the start of compare_duration, but did not match
      the filter at read_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the
      only possible state_change is "UNUSED", which will be the state_change
      set for all findings present at read_time.
    fieldMask: A field mask to specify the Finding fields to be listed in the
      response. An empty field mask will list all fields.
    filter: Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings. The
      expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical
      operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher
      precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-`
      character in front of them to indicate negation. Examples include: *
      name * source_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The
      supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `>`, `<`, `>=`,
      `<=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.
      The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer
      literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without
      quotes. The following field and operator combinations are supported: *
      name: `=` * parent: `=`, `:` * resource_name: `=`, `:` * state: `=`, `:`
      * category: `=`, `:` * external_uri: `=`, `:` * event_time: `=`, `>`,
      `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an
      RFC3339 string. Examples: `event_time = "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"`
      `event_time = 1560208038000` * severity: `=`, `:` * workflow_state: `=`,
      `:` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` * source_properties: `=`, `:`, `>`,
      `<`, `>=`, `<=` For example, `source_properties.size = 100` is a valid
      filter string. Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based
      on a property existing: `source_properties.my_property : ""` Use a
      negated partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property
      not existing: `-source_properties.my_property : ""` * resource: *
      resource.name: `=`, `:` * resource.parent_name: `=`, `:` *
      resource.parent_display_name: `=`, `:` * resource.project_name: `=`, `:`

      `:`
    orderBy: Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting.
      The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of
      fields. For example: "name,resource_properties.a_property". The default
      sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a
      suffix " desc" should be appended to the field name. For example: "name

class SecuritycenterProjectsSourcesFindingsListRequest(_messages.Message):
  r"""A SecuritycenterProjectsSourcesFindingsListRequest object.

  Fields:
    compareDuration: When compare_duration is set, the ListFindingsResult's
      "state_change" attribute is updated to indicate whether the finding had
      its state changed, the finding's state remained unchanged, or if the
      finding was added in any state during the compare_duration period of
      time that precedes the read_time. This is the time between (read_time -
      compare_duration) and read_time. The state_change value is derived based
      on the presence and state of the finding at the two points in time.
      Intermediate state changes between the two times don't affect the
      result. For example, the results aren't affected if the finding is made
      inactive and then active again. Possible "state_change" values when
      compare_duration is specified: * "CHANGED": indicates that the finding
      was present and matched the given filter at the start of
      compare_duration, but changed its state at read_time. * "UNCHANGED":
      indicates that the finding was present and matched the given filter at
      the start of compare_duration and did not change state at read_time. *
      "ADDED": indicates that the finding did not match the given filter or
      was not present at the start of compare_duration, but was present at
      read_time. * "REMOVED": indicates that the finding was present and
      matched the filter at the start of compare_duration, but did not match
      the filter at read_time. If compare_duration is not specified, then the
      only possible state_change is "UNUSED", which will be the state_change
      set for all findings present at read_time.
    fieldMask: A field mask to specify the Finding fields to be listed in the
      response. An empty field mask will list all fields.
    filter: Expression that defines the filter to apply across findings. The
      expression is a list of one or more restrictions combined via logical
      operators `AND` and `OR`. Parentheses are supported, and `OR` has higher
      precedence than `AND`. Restrictions have the form ` ` and may have a `-`
      character in front of them to indicate negation. Examples include: *
      name * source_properties.a_property * security_marks.marks.marka The
      supported operators are: * `=` for all value types. * `>`, `<`, `>=`,
      `<=` for integer values. * `:`, meaning substring matching, for strings.
      The supported value types are: * string literals in quotes. * integer
      literals without quotes. * boolean literals `true` and `false` without
      quotes. The following field and operator combinations are supported: *
      name: `=` * parent: `=`, `:` * resource_name: `=`, `:` * state: `=`, `:`
      * category: `=`, `:` * external_uri: `=`, `:` * event_time: `=`, `>`,
      `<`, `>=`, `<=` Usage: This should be milliseconds since epoch or an
      RFC3339 string. Examples: `event_time = "2019-06-10T16:07:18-07:00"`
      `event_time = 1560208038000` * severity: `=`, `:` * workflow_state: `=`,
      `:` * security_marks.marks: `=`, `:` * source_properties: `=`, `:`, `>`,
      `<`, `>=`, `<=` For example, `source_properties.size = 100` is a valid
      filter string. Use a partial match on the empty string to filter based
      on a property existing: `source_properties.my_property : ""` Use a
      negated partial match on the empty string to filter based on a property
      not existing: `-source_properties.my_property : ""` * resource: *
      resource.name: `=`, `:` * resource.parent_name: `=`, `:` *
      resource.parent_display_name: `=`, `:` * resource.project_name: `=`, `:`
      * resource.project_display_name: `=`, `:` * resource.type: `=`, `:` *
      resource.folders.resource_folder: `=`, `:` * resource.display_name: `=`,
      `:`
    orderBy: Expression that defines what fields and order to use for sorting.
      The string value should follow SQL syntax: comma separated list of
      fields. For example: "name,resource_properties.a_property". The default
      sorting order is ascending. To specify descending order for a field, a
      suffix " desc" should be appended to the field name. For example: "name
      desc,source_properties.a_property". Redundant space characters in the
      syntax are insignificant. "name desc,source_properties.a_property" and "
      name desc , source_properties.a_property " are equivalent. The following
      fields are supported: name parent state category resource_name
      event_time source_properties security_marks.marks
    pageSize: The maximum number of results to return in a single response.
      Default is 10, minimum is 1, maximum is 1000.
    pageToken: The value returned by the last `ListFindingsResponse`;
      indicates that this is a continuation of a prior `ListFindings` call,
      and that the system should return the next page of data.
    parent: Required. Name of the source the findings belong to. Its format is
      `organizations/[organization_id]/sources/[source_id]`,
      `folders/[folder_id]/sources/[source_id]`, or
      `projects/[project_id]/sources/[source_id]`. To list across all sources
      provide a source_id of `-`. For example:
      `organizations/{organization_id}/sources/-`,
      `folders/{folder_id}/sources/-` or `projects/{projects_id}/sources/-`
    readTime: Time used as a reference point when filtering findings. The
      filter is limited to findings existing at the supplied time and their
      values are those at that specific time. Absence of this field will
      default to the API's version of NOW.
