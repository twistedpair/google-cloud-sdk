  r"""A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated

  enabled: { "reason": "API_DISABLED" "domain": "googleapis.com" "metadata": {
  "resource": "projects/123", "service": "pubsub.googleapis.com" } } This
  response indicates that the pubsub.googleapis.com API is not enabled.
  Example of an error that is returned when attempting to create a Spanner
  instance in a region that is out of stock: { "reason": "STOCKOUT" "domain":
  "spanner.googleapis.com", "metadata": { "availableRegions": "us-central1,us-
  east2" } }

  Messages:
    MetadataValue: Additional structured details about this error. Keys must
      match a regular expression of `a-z+` but should ideally be
      lowerCamelCase. Also, they must be limited to 64 characters in length.
      When identifying the current value of an exceeded limit, the units
      should be contained in the key, not the value. For example, rather than
      `{"instanceLimit": "100/request"}`, should be returned as,
      `{"instanceLimitPerRequest": "100"}`, if the client exceeds the number
      of instances that can be created in a single (batch) request.

  Fields:
    domain: The logical grouping to which the "reason" belongs. The error
      domain is typically the registered service name of the tool or product
      that generates the error. Example: "pubsub.googleapis.com". If the error
      is generated by some common infrastructure, the error domain must be a
      globally unique value that identifies the infrastructure. For Google API
      infrastructure, the error domain is "googleapis.com".

      created in a single (batch) request.
    reason: The reason of the error. This is a constant value that identifies
      the proximate cause of the error. Error reasons are unique within a
      particular domain of errors. This should be at most 63 characters and
      match a regular expression of `A-Z+[A-Z0-9]`, which represents
      UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.

  r"""PolicyOrchestrator helps managing project+zone level policy resources
  (e.g. OS Policy Assignments), by providing tools to create, update and
  delete them across projects and locations, at scale. Policy orchestrator
  functions as an endless loop. Each iteration orchestrator computes a set of
  resources that should be affected, then progressively applies changes to
  them. If for some reason this set of resources changes over time (e.g. new
  projects are added), the future loop iterations will address that.
  Orchestrator can either upsert or delete policy resources. For more details,
  see the description of the `action`, and `orchestrated_resource` fields.
  Note that policy orchestrator do not "manage" the resources it creates.
  Every iteration is independent and only minimal history of past actions is
  retained (apart from Cloud Logging). If orchestrator gets deleted, it does
  not affect the resources it created in the past. Those will remain where
  they were. Same applies if projects are removed from the orchestrator's
  scope.

    requestId: Optional. An optional request ID to identify requests. Specify

      will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The
      server will guarantee that for at least 60 minutes after the first
      request. For example, consider a situation where you make an initial
      request and the request times out. If you make the request again with
      the same request ID, the server can check if original operation with the
      same request ID was received, and if so, will ignore the second request.
