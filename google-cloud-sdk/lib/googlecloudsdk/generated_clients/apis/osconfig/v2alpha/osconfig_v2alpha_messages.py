  affected, and progressivly applies changes to them. If for some reasone,
  this set of resources changes over time (e.g. new projects are added), the
  future loop iterations will address that. Orchestrator can either upsert or

  not "manage" the resources it creates. Every iteration is independent and
  only minimal history of past actions is retained (apart from Cloud Logging).
  If orchestrator gets deleted, it does not affect the resources it created in

      Expansion starts with a Project / Folder / Organization resource
      parenting the PolicyOrchestrator resource: - All the descendant projects
      are listed (or a single one, if parent is a project already). - List of

      resources, where `project` and `zone` pairs come from the expanded
      scope, and `resource_id` comes from the `resource_id` field of
      orchestrator resource.
    policyId: ID of the resource to be used while generating set of affected
      resources. For UPSERT action, the value is auto-generated during
      PolicyOrchestrator creation, when not set. When the value is set, it
      should following next restrictions: * Must contain only lowercase
      letters, numbers, and hyphens. * Must start with a letter. * Must be

      explicitly during PolicyOrchestrator creation.
    reconciling: Output only. Set to true, if the resource is currently being

    state: State of the orchestrator. Can be updated to change orchestrator

  different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
  used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains
  three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can
  find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API
  Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).

  Messages:
    DetailsValueListEntry: A DetailsValueListEntry object.

  Fields:
    code: The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.
    details: A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a
      common set of message types for APIs to use.
    message: A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any
      user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the
      google.rpc.Status.details field, or localized by the client.
