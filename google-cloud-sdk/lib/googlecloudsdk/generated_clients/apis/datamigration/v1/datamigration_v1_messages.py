      binding. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM
      policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).
    members: Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud
      resource. `members` can have the following values: * `allUsers`: A

      or without a Google account. * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special
      identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google
      account or a service account. Does not include identities that come from
      external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation. *

      example, `admins@example.com`. * `domain:{domain}`: The G Suite domain
      (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example,
      `google.com` or `example.com`. *
      `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique
      identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: -
  user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com -
  serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role:
  roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable

  version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
