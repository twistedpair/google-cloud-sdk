class GoogleApiDistribution(_messages.Message):
  r"""`Distribution` contains summary statistics for a population of values.
  It optionally contains a histogram representing the distribution of those
  values across a set of buckets. The summary statistics are the count, mean,
  sum of the squared deviation from the mean, the minimum, and the maximum of
  the set of population of values. The histogram is based on a sequence of
  buckets and gives a count of values that fall into each bucket. The
  boundaries of the buckets are given either explicitly or by formulas for
  buckets of fixed or exponentially increasing widths. Although it is not
  forbidden, it is generally a bad idea to include non-finite values
  (infinities or NaNs) in the population of values, as this will render the
  `mean` and `sum_of_squared_deviation` fields meaningless.

  Fields:
    bucketCounts: The number of values in each bucket of the histogram, as
      described in `bucket_options`. If the distribution does not have a
      histogram, then omit this field. If there is a histogram, then the sum
      of the values in `bucket_counts` must equal the value in the `count`
      field of the distribution. If present, `bucket_counts` should contain N
      values, where N is the number of buckets specified in `bucket_options`.
      If you supply fewer than N values, the remaining values are assumed to
      be 0. The order of the values in `bucket_counts` follows the bucket
      numbering schemes described for the three bucket types. The first value
      must be the count for the underflow bucket (number 0). The next N-2
      values are the counts for the finite buckets (number 1 through N-2). The
      N'th value in `bucket_counts` is the count for the overflow bucket
      (number N-1).
    bucketOptions: Defines the histogram bucket boundaries. If the
      distribution does not contain a histogram, then omit this field.
    count: The number of values in the population. Must be non-negative. This
      value must equal the sum of the values in `bucket_counts` if a histogram
      is provided.
    exemplars: Must be in increasing order of `value` field.
    mean: The arithmetic mean of the values in the population. If `count` is
      zero then this field must be zero.
    range: If specified, contains the range of the population values. The
      field must not be present if the `count` is zero.
    sumOfSquaredDeviation: The sum of squared deviations from the mean of the
      values in the population. For values x_i this is: Sum[i=1..n]((x_i -
      mean)^2) Knuth, "The Art of Computer Programming", Vol. 2, page 232, 3rd
      edition describes Welford's method for accumulating this sum in one
      pass. If `count` is zero then this field must be zero.

  `BucketOptions` does not include the number of values in each bucket. A
  bucket has an inclusive lower bound and exclusive upper bound for the values
  that are counted for that bucket. The upper bound of a bucket must be
  strictly greater than the lower bound. The sequence of N buckets for a
  distribution consists of an underflow bucket (number 0), zero or more finite
  buckets (number 1 through N - 2) and an overflow bucket (number N - 1). The
  buckets are contiguous: the lower bound of bucket i (i > 0) is the same as
  the upper bound of bucket i - 1. The buckets span the whole range of finite
  values: lower bound of the underflow bucket is -infinity and the upper bound
  of the overflow bucket is +infinity. The finite buckets are so-called
