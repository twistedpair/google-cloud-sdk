"""Generated message classes for privilegedaccessmanager version v1alpha.

Privileged Access Manager (PAM) helps you to follow least privilege best
practice to mitigate risks tied to privileged access misuse and abuse. You can
shift from always-on standing privileges to on-demand access using time-bound
and approval-based access elevations. IAM administrators specifically can use
PAM to create entitlements that can grant temporary access to a specific
resource scope. Requesters can explore eligible entitlements and request the
access needed for their task, and approvers are notified when approvals
require their attention. Streamlined workflows facilitated using PAM support
several use cases, including the following: * Emergency access for incident
responders * Time-boxed access for developers for critical deployment or
maintenance * Temporary access for operators for data ingestion and audits *
Temporary access to service accounts for automated tasks
