      already present in the current field value. If the field is not an
      array, or if the field does not yet exist, it is first set to the empty
      array. Equivalent numbers of different types (e.g. 3L and 3.0) are
      considered equal when checking if a value is missing. NaN is equal to
      NaN, and Null is equal to Null. If the input contains multiple
      equivalent values, only the first will be considered. The corresponding
      transform_result will be the null value.
    fieldPath: The path of the field. See Document.fields for the field path
      syntax reference.
    increment: Adds the given value to the field's current value. This must be
      an integer or a double value. If the field is not an integer or double,
      or if the field does not yet exist, the transformation will set the
      field to the given value. If either of the given value or the current
      field value are doubles, both values will be interpreted as doubles.
      Double arithmetic and representation of double values follow IEEE 754

      resolved to the largest magnitude positive/negative integer.
    maximum: Sets the field to the maximum of its current value and the given
      value. This must be an integer or a double value. If the field is not an
      integer or double, or if the field does not yet exist, the
      transformation will set the field to the given value. If a maximum
      operation is applied where the field and the input value are of mixed
      types (that is - one is an integer and one is a double) the field takes
      on the type of the larger operand. If the operands are equivalent (e.g.
      3 and 3.0), the field does not change. 0, 0.0, and -0.0 are all zero.
      The maximum of a zero stored value and zero input value is always the
      stored value. The maximum of any numeric value x and NaN is NaN.
    minimum: Sets the field to the minimum of its current value and the given
      value. This must be an integer or a double value. If the field is not an
      integer or double, or if the field does not yet exist, the
      transformation will set the field to the input value. If a minimum
      operation is applied where the field and the input value are of mixed

      on the type of the smaller operand. If the operands are equivalent (e.g.
      3 and 3.0), the field does not change. 0, 0.0, and -0.0 are all zero.
      The minimum of a zero stored value and zero input value is always the

  Fields:
    endAt: A potential prefix of a position in the result set to end the query

      position rather than the start position. Requires: * The number of
      values cannot be greater than the number of fields specified in the

    findNearest: Optional. A potential nearest neighbors search. Applies after
      all other filters and ordering. Finds the closest vector embeddings to
      the given query vector.
    from_: The collections to query.
    limit: The maximum number of results to return. Applies after all other

    orderBy: The order to apply to the query results. Firestore allows callers
      to provide a full ordering, a partial ordering, or no ordering at all.
      In all cases, Firestore guarantees a stable ordering through the
      following rules: * The `order_by` is required to reference all fields
      used with an inequality filter. * All fields that are required to be in
      the `order_by` but are not already present are appended in
      lexicographical ordering of the field name. * If an order on `__name__`
      is not specified, it is appended by default. Fields are appended with
      the same sort direction as the last order specified, or 'ASCENDING' if
      no order was specified. For example: * `ORDER BY a` becomes `ORDER BY a
      ASC, __name__ ASC` * `ORDER BY a DESC` becomes `ORDER BY a DESC,
      __name__ DESC` * `WHERE a > 1` becomes `WHERE a > 1 ORDER BY a ASC,
      __name__ ASC` * `WHERE __name__ > ... AND a > 1` becomes `WHERE __name__
      > ... AND a > 1 ORDER BY a ASC, __name__ ASC`
    select: Optional sub-set of the fields to return. This acts as a
      DocumentMask over the documents returned from a query. When not set,
      assumes that the caller wants all fields returned.
    startAt: A potential prefix of a position in the result set to start the
      query at. The ordering of the result set is based on the `ORDER BY`
      clause of the original query. ``` SELECT * FROM k WHERE a = 1 AND b > 2
      ORDER BY b ASC, __name__ ASC; ``` This query's results are ordered by

      or a prefix of the location, though it cannot reference more fields than
      what are in the provided `ORDER BY`. Continuing off the example above,

      = 1 AND b > 10`. Unlike `OFFSET` which requires scanning over the first
      N results to skip, a start cursor allows the query to begin at a logical
      position. This position is not required to match an actual result, it
      will scan forward from this position to find the next document.

    readTime: Start listening after a specific `read_time`. The client must

    resumeToken: A resume token from a prior TargetChange for an identical
