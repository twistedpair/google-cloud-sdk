A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/iam\/help\/conditions\/resource-policies). **JSON example:** { \"bindings\": [ { \"role\": \"roles\/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin\", \"members\": [ \"user:mike@example.com\", \"group:admins@example.com\", \"domain:google.com\", \"serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com\" ] }, { \"role\": \"roles\/resourcemanager.organizationViewer\", \"members\": [ \"user:eve@example.com\" ], \"condition\": { \"title\": \"expirable access\", \"description\": \"Does not grant access after Sep 2020\", \"expression\": \"request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')\", } } ], \"etag\": \"BwWWja0YfJA=\", \"version\": 3 } **YAML example:** bindings: - members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com - domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com role: roles\/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: - user:eve@example.com role: roles\/resourcemanager.organizationViewer condition: title: expirable access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression: request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the [IAM documentation](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/iam\/docs\/).",

Setting `Policy` hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn't recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set. In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values` and not present in `denied_values`. For example, suppose you have a `Constraint` `constraints\/serviceuser.services`, which has a `constraint_type` of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default` set to `ALLOW`. Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is applied that restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}. Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied. The following examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `projects\/bar` parented by `organizations\/foo`: Example 1 (no inherited values): `organizations\/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values:\"E2\"} `projects\/bar` has `inherit_from_parent` `false` and values: {allowed_values: \"E3\" allowed_values: \"E4\"} The accepted values at `organizations\/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.

The accepted values at `projects\/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`. Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values): `organizations\/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values: \"E2\"} `projects\/bar` has a `Policy` with: {denied_values: \"E1\"} The accepted values at `organizations\/foo` are `E1`, `E2`.

Example 4 (RestoreDefault): `organizations\/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values:\"E2\"} `projects\/bar` has a `Policy` with values: {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at `organizations\/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at `projects\/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 5 (no policy inherits parent policy): `organizations\/foo` has no `Policy` set. `projects\/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both levels are either all or none depending on the value of `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none). Example 6 (ListConstraint allowing all): `organizations\/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values: \"E2\"} `projects\/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: ALLOW} The accepted values at `organizations\/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any value is accepted at `projects\/bar`. Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none): `organizations\/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: \"E1\" allowed_values: \"E2\"} `projects\/bar` has a `Policy` with: {all: DENY} The accepted values at `organizations\/foo` are `E1`, E2`. No value is accepted at `projects\/bar`. Example 10 (allowed and denied subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following resource hierarchy O1->{F1, F2}; F1->{P1}; F2->{P2, P3}, `organizations\/foo` has a `Policy` with values: {allowed_values: \"under:organizations\/O1\"} `projects\/bar` has a `Policy` with: {allowed_values: \"under:projects\/P3\"} {denied_values: \"under:folders\/F2\"} The accepted values at `organizations\/foo` are `organizations\/O1`, `folders\/F1`, `folders\/F2`, `projects\/P1`, `projects\/P2`, `projects\/P3`. The accepted values at `projects\/bar` are `organizations\/O1`, `folders\/F1`, `projects\/P1`.",

(b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence. (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed.

There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`.
