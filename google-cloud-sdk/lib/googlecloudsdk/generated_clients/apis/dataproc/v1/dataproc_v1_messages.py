    configBucket: Optional. A Cloud Storage bucket used to stage job
      dependencies, config files, and job driver console output. If you do not
      specify a staging bucket, Cloud Dataproc will determine a Cloud Storage
      location (US, ASIA, or EU) for your cluster's staging bucket according
      to the Compute Engine zone where your cluster is deployed, and then
      create and manage this project-level, per-location bucket (see Dataproc
      staging and temp buckets
      (https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/configuring-
      clusters/staging-bucket)). This field requires a Cloud Storage bucket
      name, not a gs://... URI to a Cloud Storage bucket.
    dataprocMetricConfig: Optional. The config for Dataproc metrics.
    encryptionConfig: Optional. Encryption settings for the cluster.

      Dataproc clusters deployed to The Kubernetes Engine config for Dataproc
      clusters deployed to Kubernetes. These config settings are mutually
      exclusive with Compute Engine-based options, such as gce_cluster_config,
      master_config, worker_config, secondary_worker_config, and
      autoscaling_config.
    initializationActions: Optional. Commands to execute on each node after
      config is completed. By default, executables are run on master and all
      worker nodes. You can test a node's role metadata to run an executable
      on a master or worker node, as shown below using curl (you can also use
      wget): ROLE=$(curl -H Metadata-Flavor:Google
      http://metadata/computeMetadata/v1/instance/attributes/dataproc-role) if
      [[ "${ROLE}" == 'Master' ]]; then ... master specific actions ... else
      ... worker specific actions ... fi
    lifecycleConfig: Optional. Lifecycle setting for the cluster.
    masterConfig: Optional. The Compute Engine config settings for the
      cluster's master instance.
    metastoreConfig: Optional. Metastore configuration.
    secondaryWorkerConfig: Optional. The Compute Engine config settings for a
      cluster's secondary worker instances
    securityConfig: Optional. Security settings for the cluster.
    softwareConfig: Optional. The config settings for cluster software.
    tempBucket: Optional. A Cloud Storage bucket used to store ephemeral
      cluster and jobs data, such as Spark and MapReduce history files. If you
      do not specify a temp bucket, Dataproc will determine a Cloud Storage
      location (US, ASIA, or EU) for your cluster's temp bucket according to
      the Compute Engine zone where your cluster is deployed, and then create
      and manage this project-level, per-location bucket. The default bucket
      has a TTL of 90 days, but you can use any TTL (or none) if you specify a
      bucket (see Dataproc staging and temp buckets
      (https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/configuring-
      clusters/staging-bucket)). This field requires a Cloud Storage bucket
      name, not a gs://... URI to a Cloud Storage bucket.

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources.A Policy is a collection of bindings. A
  binding binds one or more members, or principals, to a single role.
  Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google groups, and
  domains (such as G Suite). A role is a named list of permissions; each role
  can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created custom role.For some types
  of Google Cloud resources, a binding can also specify a condition, which is
  a logical expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression
  evaluates to true. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of
  the request, the resource, or both. To learn which resources support
  conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation
  (https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).JSON
  example: { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",
  "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020", "expression":
  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } YAML example: bindings: - members: -

  access description: Does not grant access after Sep 2020 expression:
  request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z') etag: BwWWja0YfJA=
  version: 3 For a description of IAM and its features, see the IAM
  documentation (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    bindings: Associates a list of members, or principals, with a role.
      Optionally, may specify a condition that determines how and when the
      bindings are applied. Each of the bindings must contain at least one
      principal.The bindings in a Policy can refer to up to 1,500 principals;
      up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each occurrence of a
      principal counts towards these limits. For example, if the bindings
      grant 50 different roles to user:alice@example.com, and not to any other
      principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to the bindings in
      the Policy.
    etag: etag is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the etag in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An etag is returned in the response to getIamPolicy, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to setIamPolicy to
      ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.Important: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the etag
      field whenever you call setIamPolicy. If you omit this field, then IAM
      allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy, and
      all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy.Valid values are 0, 1, and 3.
      Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.Any operation that
      affects conditional role bindings must specify version 3. This
      requirement applies to the following operations: Getting a policy that
      includes a conditional role binding Adding a conditional role binding to
      a policy Changing a conditional role binding in a policy Removing any
      role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy that includes
      conditionsImportant: If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      etag field whenever you call setIamPolicy. If you omit this field, then
      IAM allows you to overwrite a version 3 policy with a version 1 policy,
      and all of the conditions in the version 3 policy are lost.If a policy
      does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify
      any valid version or leave the field unset.To learn which resources
      support conditions in their IAM policies, see the IAM documentation
      (https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
