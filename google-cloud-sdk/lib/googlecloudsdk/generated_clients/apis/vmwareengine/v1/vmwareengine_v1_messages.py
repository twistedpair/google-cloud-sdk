  Fields:
    action: The action that the external access rule performs.
    createTime: Output only. Creation time of this resource.
    description: User-provided description for this external access rule.
    destinationIpRanges: If destination ranges are specified, the external
      access rule applies only to the traffic that has a destination IP
      address in these ranges. The specified IP addresses must have reserved
      external IP addresses in the scope of the parent network policy. To
      match all external IP addresses in the scope of the parent network
      policy, specify `0.0.0.0/0`. To match a specific external IP address,
      specify it using the `IpRange.external_address` property.
    destinationPorts: A list of destination ports to which the external access
      rule applies. This field is only applicable for the UDP or TCP protocol.
      Each entry must be either an integer or a range. For example: `["22"]`,
      `["80","443"]`, or `["12345-12349"]`. To match all destination ports,
      specify `["0-65535"]`.
    ipProtocol: The IP protocol to which the external access rule applies.
      This value can be one of the following three protocol strings (not case-
      sensitive): `tcp`, `udp`, or `icmp`.
    name: Output only. The resource name of this external access rule.
      Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions in
      https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example:
      `projects/my-project/locations/us-central1/networkPolicies/my-
      policy/externalAccessRules/my-rule`
    priority: External access rule priority, which determines the external
      access rule to use when multiple rules apply. If multiple rules have the
      same priority, their ordering is non-deterministic. If specific ordering
      is required, assign unique priorities to enforce such ordering. The
      external access rule priority is an integer from 100 to 4096, both
      inclusive. Lower integers indicate higher precedence. For example, a
      rule with priority `100` has higher precedence than a rule with priority
      `101`.
    sourceIpRanges: If source ranges are specified, the external access rule
      applies only to traffic that has a source IP address in these ranges.
      These ranges can either be expressed in the CIDR format or as an IP
      address. As only inbound rules are supported, `ExternalAddress`
      resources cannot be the source IP addresses of an external access rule.
      To match all source addresses, specify `0.0.0.0/0`.
    sourcePorts: A list of source ports to which the external access rule
      applies. This field is only applicable for the UDP or TCP protocol. Each
      entry must be either an integer or a range. For example: `["22"]`,

class Policy(_messages.Message):
  r"""An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
  controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
  `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
  single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
  groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
  permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
  custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can also
  specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows access to a
  resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A condition can add
  constraints based on attributes of the request, the resource, or both. To
  learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
  documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
  policies). **JSON example:** ``` { "bindings": [ { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin", "members": [
  "user:mike@example.com", "group:admins@example.com", "domain:google.com",
  "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com" ] }, { "role":
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer", "members": [
  "user:eve@example.com" ], "condition": { "title": "expirable access",

  "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')", } } ], "etag":
  "BwWWja0YfJA=", "version": 3 } ``` **YAML example:** ``` bindings: -
  members: - user:mike@example.com - group:admins@example.com -
  domain:google.com - serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin - members: -

  etag: BwWWja0YfJA= version: 3 ``` For a description of IAM and its features,
  see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/).

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members`, or principals, with a `role`.
      Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when the
      `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one
      principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to 1,500
      principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google groups. Each
      occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits. For example, if
      the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to `user:alice@example.com`, and
      not to any other principal, then you can add another 1,450 principals to
      the `bindings` in the `Policy`.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy. **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy that includes conditions **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset. To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-

      operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
      must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must
      be `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`. For example, if you are filtering a list of
      subnets, you can exclude the ones named `example-subnet` by specifying
      `name != "example-subnet"`. To filter on multiple expressions, provide
      each separate expression within parentheses. For example: ``` (name =

      "example-subnet-1") AND (subnetId > "example-subnet-id") OR (name =
      "example-subnet-2") ```
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, returned
      results are ordered by `name` in ascending order. You can also sort
      results in descending order based on the `name` value using
      `orderBy="name desc"`. Currently, only ordering by `name` is supported.

  r"""A VmwareengineProjectsLocationsVmwareEngineNetworksDeleteRequest object.

  Fields:
    etag: Optional. Checksum used to ensure that the user-provided value is up
      to date before the server processes the request. The server compares
      provided checksum with the current checksum of the resource. If the
      user-provided value is out of date, this request returns an `ABORTED`
      error.
    name: Required. The resource name of the VMware Engine network to be
      deleted. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the conventions
      in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For example:
      `projects/my-project/locations/global/vmwareEngineNetworks/my-network`
    requestId: Optional. A request ID to identify requests. Specify a unique
      request ID so that if you must retry your request, the server will know
      to ignore the request if it has already been completed. The server
      guarantees that a request doesn't result in creation of duplicate
      commitments for at least 60 minutes. For example, consider a situation
      where you make an initial request and the request times out. If you make
      the request again with the same request ID, the server can check if
      original operation with the same request ID was received, and if so,
      will ignore the second request. This prevents clients from accidentally
      creating duplicate commitments. The request ID must be a valid UUID with
      the exception that zero UUID is not supported

  r"""A VmwareengineProjectsLocationsVmwareEngineNetworksListRequest object.

  Fields:
    filter: A filter expression that matches resources returned in the
      response. The expression must specify the field name, a comparison
      operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. The value
      must be a string, a number, or a boolean. The comparison operator must
      be `=`, `!=`, `>`, or `<`. For example, if you are filtering a list of
      network peerings, you can exclude the ones named `example-network` by
      specifying `name != "example-network"`. To filter on multiple
      expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. For
      example: ``` (name = "example-network") (createTime >
      "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z") ``` By default, each expression is an `AND`
      expression. However, you can include `AND` and `OR` expressions
      explicitly. For example: ``` (name = "example-network-1") AND
      (createTime > "2021-04-12T08:15:10.40Z") OR (name = "example-network-2")
      ```
    orderBy: Sorts list results by a certain order. By default, returned
      results are ordered by `name` in ascending order. You can also sort
      results in descending order based on the `name` value using
      `orderBy="name desc"`. Currently, only ordering by `name` is supported.
    pageSize: The maximum number of results to return in one page. The maximum
      value is coerced to 1000. The default value of this field is 500.
    pageToken: A page token, received from a previous
      `ListVmwareEngineNetworks` call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent
      page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to
      `ListVmwareEngineNetworks` must match the call that provided the page
      token.
    parent: Required. The resource name of the location to query for VMware
      Engine networks. Resource names are schemeless URIs that follow the
      conventions in https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names. For
