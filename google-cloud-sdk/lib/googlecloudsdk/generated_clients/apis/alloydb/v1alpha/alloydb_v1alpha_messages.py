"""Generated message classes for alloydb version v1alpha.

AlloyDB for PostgreSQL is an open source-compatible database service that
provides a powerful option for migrating, modernizing, or building commercial-
grade applications. It offers full compatibility with standard PostgreSQL, and
is more than 4x faster for transactional workloads and up to 100x faster for
analytical queries than standard PostgreSQL in our performance tests. AlloyDB
for PostgreSQL offers a 99.99 percent availability SLA inclusive of
maintenance. AlloyDB is optimized for the most demanding use cases, allowing
you to build new applications that require high transaction throughput, large
database sizes, or multiple read resources; scale existing PostgreSQL
workloads with no application changes; and modernize legacy proprietary
databases.
