    r"""Optional. The severity of the findings that are generated by the cloud
    control.

    Values:
      SEVERITY_UNSPECIFIED: Default value. This value is unused.
      CRITICAL: A critical vulnerability is easily discoverable by an external
        actor, exploitable, and results in the direct ability to execute
        arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain additional access
        and privileges to cloud resources and workloads. Examples include
        publicly accessible unprotected user data and public SSH access with
        weak or no passwords. A critical threat is a threat that can access,
        modify, or delete data or execute unauthorized code within existing
        resources.
      HIGH: A high-risk vulnerability can be easily discovered and exploited
        in combination with other vulnerabilities to gain direct access and
        the ability to execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise
        gain additional access and privileges to cloud resources and
        workloads. An example is a database with weak or no passwords that is
        only accessible internally. This database could easily be compromised
        by an actor that had access to the internal network. A high-risk
        threat is a threat that can create new computational resources in an
        environment but can't access data or execute code in existing
        resources.
      MEDIUM: A medium-risk vulnerability can be used by an actor to gain
        access to resources or privileges that enable them to eventually
        (through multiple steps or a complex exploit) gain access and the
        ability to execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate data. An example is a
        service account with access to more projects than it should have. If
        an actor gains access to the service account, they could potentially
        use that access to manipulate a project the service account was not
        intended to. A medium-risk threat can cause operational impact but
        might not access data or execute unauthorized code.
      LOW: A low-risk vulnerability hampers a security organization's ability
        to detect vulnerabilities or active threats in their deployment, or
        prevents the root cause investigation of security issues. An example
        is monitoring and logs being disabled for resource configurations and
        access. A low-risk threat is a threat that has obtained minimal access
        to an environment but can't access data, execute code, or create
        resources.

    Values:

      CRITICAL: A critical vulnerability is easily discoverable by an external
        actor, exploitable, and results in the direct ability to execute
        arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain additional access
        and privileges to cloud resources and workloads. Examples include
        publicly accessible unprotected user data and public SSH access with
        weak or no passwords. A critical threat is a threat that can access,
        modify, or delete data or execute unauthorized code within existing
        resources.
      HIGH: A high-risk vulnerability can be easily discovered and exploited
        in combination with other vulnerabilities to gain direct access and
        the ability to execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise
        gain additional access and privileges to cloud resources and
        workloads. An example is a database with weak or no passwords that is
        only accessible internally. This database could easily be compromised
        by an actor that had access to the internal network. A high-risk
        threat is a threat that can create new computational resources in an
        environment but can't access data or execute code in existing
        resources.
      MEDIUM: A medium-risk vulnerability can be used by an actor to gain
        access to resources or privileges that enable them to eventually
        (through multiple steps or a complex exploit) gain access and the
        ability to execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate data. An example is a
        service account with access to more projects than it should have. If
        an actor gains access to the service account, they could potentially
        use that access to manipulate a project the service account was not
        intended to. A medium-risk threat can cause operational impact but
        might not access data or execute unauthorized code.
      LOW: A low-risk vulnerability hampers a security organization's ability
        to detect vulnerabilities or active threats in their deployment, or
        prevents the root cause investigation of security issues. An example
        is monitoring and logs being disabled for resource configurations and
        access. A low-risk threat is a threat that has obtained minimal access
        to an environment but can't access data, execute code, or create
        resources.

    Values:
      SEVERITY_UNSPECIFIED: Default value. This value is unused.
      CRITICAL: A critical vulnerability is easily discoverable by an external
        actor, exploitable, and results in the direct ability to execute
        arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain additional access
        and privileges to cloud resources and workloads. Examples include
        publicly accessible unprotected user data and public SSH access with
        weak or no passwords. A critical threat is a threat that can access,
        modify, or delete data or execute unauthorized code within existing
        resources.
      HIGH: A high-risk vulnerability can be easily discovered and exploited
        in combination with other vulnerabilities to gain direct access and
        the ability to execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise
        gain additional access and privileges to cloud resources and
        workloads. An example is a database with weak or no passwords that is
        only accessible internally. This database could easily be compromised
        by an actor that had access to the internal network. A high-risk
        threat is a threat that can create new computational resources in an
        environment but can't access data or execute code in existing
        resources.
      MEDIUM: A medium-risk vulnerability can be used by an actor to gain
        access to resources or privileges that enable them to eventually
        (through multiple steps or a complex exploit) gain access and the
        ability to execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate data. An example is a
        service account with access to more projects than it should have. If
        an actor gains access to the service account, they could potentially
        use that access to manipulate a project the service account was not
        intended to. A medium-risk threat can cause operational impact but
        might not access data or execute unauthorized code.
      LOW: A low-risk vulnerability hampers a security organization's ability
        to detect vulnerabilities or active threats in their deployment, or
        prevents the root cause investigation of security issues. An example
        is monitoring and logs being disabled for resource configurations and
        access. A low-risk threat is a threat that has obtained minimal access
        to an environment but can't access data, execute code, or create
        resources.
