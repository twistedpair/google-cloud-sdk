class WorkerPoolsRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for WorkerPools.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the WorkerPoolsRestTransport.

                It is used to specify access control policies for Cloud
                Platform resources.

                A ``Policy`` is a collection of ``bindings``. A
                ``binding`` binds one or more ``members`` to a single
                ``role``. Members can be user accounts, service
                accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite).
                A ``role`` is a named list of permissions (defined by
                IAM or configured by users). A ``binding`` can
                optionally specify a ``condition``, which is a logic
                expression that further constrains the role binding
                based on attributes about the request and/or target
                resource.

                    Defines an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy.
                It is used to specify access control policies for Cloud
                Platform resources.

                A ``Policy`` is a collection of ``bindings``. A
                ``binding`` binds one or more ``members`` to a single
                ``role``. Members can be user accounts, service
                accounts, Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite).
                A ``role`` is a named list of permissions (defined by
                IAM or configured by users). A ``binding`` can
                optionally specify a ``condition``, which is a logic
                expression that further constrains the role binding
                based on attributes about the request and/or target
                resource.
