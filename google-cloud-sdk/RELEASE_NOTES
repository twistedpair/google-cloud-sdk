Copyright 2014-2017 Google Inc. All rights reserved.

## 144.0.0 (2017-02-15)

### Breaking Changes

* Many Cloud SQL commands now prompt for confirmation in more circumstances:
  * `gcloud sql instances import`
  * `gcloud beta sql instances import`
  * `gcloud beta sql instances failover`
  * `gcloud sql instances promote-replica`
  * `gcloud beta sql instances promote-replica`
  * `gcloud sql instances reset-ssl-config`
  * `gcloud beta sql instances reset-ssl-config`
  * `gcloud sql instances restart`
  * `gcloud beta sql instances restart`
  * `gcloud sql ssl-certs delete`
  * `gcloud beta sql ssl-certs delete`
  * `gcloud beta sql users delete`
* `gcloud compute backend-services` now requires an explicit scope.
  Pass `--global` to retain the old behavior.

### Deployment Manager

* `deployment-manager deployments {update,stop,cancel-preview}` can take
  `--fingerprint` flag to ensure optimistic locking.
* The `gcloud deployment-manager runtime-configs` command group is now available
  as a top-level command group: `gcloud runtime-configs`.

### Google App Engine

* Fixed a bug in `gcloud app instances list` where instances were always listed
  as NOT in debug mode.
* Added `--container` flag to `gcloud beta app instances ssh`, which lets you
  SSH straight into the app container within the instance VM.
* Deployments using `vm: true` have been deprecated. Please update your app.yaml
  to use `env: flex`. To learn more, please visit
  <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/migration>.
* Added Google Analytics reporting to the dev_appserver.py binary. This is only
  enabled for users who have opted in during installation.

### Google Cloud Datalab

* Update the datalab command line tool to the 20170208 build.
  This update includes the following changes:
  1. All subcommands of the `datalab` tool now support a `--quiet` flag for
     disabling interactive prompts.
  2. You can now configure the logging threshold for messages that Datalab
     instances write to StackDriver logging. The default is `warn`, but
     this can be overridden by passing in the `--log-level` flag.
  3. The `datalab create` and `datalab connect` commands are more intelligent
     about when they should open a browser. In particular, they detect if
     the configured browser is a text-only browser or if the command is
     being run from inside of Google Cloud Shell, and do not attempt to
     launch the browser in those cases.
  4. The tool will now detect and warn if two users try to share a single
     Datalab instance, as that use case is not supported.
  5. Newly created Datalab instances use the Container Optimized OS
     rather than the older Container VM OS.

### Google Cloud Functions

  `--cpu` flags.
* Add ability to delete backups in SQL beta CLI
  (`gcloud beta sql backups delete`).
* If a user does not confirm a backup deletion, immediately cancel the
  operation. Also bringing this function into line with others in the SQL CLI.
  Affects one command:
  * `gcloud beta sql backups delete`

### Google Compute Engine

* Accelerators (e.g. GPUs) can now be attached to instances by passing
  `--accelerator` to `gcloud beta compute instances create`.
* `gcloud beta compute accelerator-types` is now available in beta.

  (permissive) is deprecated and will be removed in 6 months. To preserve old
  behavior in your scripts, use new flag --force-key-file-overwrite
  (though this is discouraged).

    instances start`. (in beta track)
*   Implemented backend-service connection based balancing mode.

### Google Service Registry

*   Launched `gcloud alpha service-registry`. (alpha track)
    Users will need to sign up
    [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11SfJGB3LUGgT_aSMlVzWoJ0ec2fHKwk0J4e-zTNw0Bs/viewform?edit_requested=true)
    before enabling this API in their projects.

### Deployment Manager

    Deployment Manager's Runtime Config API.

### Emulators

*   Adds a `--legacy` flag to gcloud beta emulators datastore. The flag is set
    by default and maintains existing behavior with support for Cloud Datastore
    API v1beta2. Passing `--no-legacy` uses a new version of the Cloud Datastore
    Emulator which supports Cloud Datastore API v1beta3 over gRPC, JSON, and
    proto-over-HTTP. The default behavior of the legacy flag will change in a
    future release.

### Organizations

*   Because of the rollback of 91.0.0, this release contains all of the changes
    from 91.0.0 in addition to the changes listed below.

### Breaking Changes

*   `gcloud preview app deploy`

    *   Changed deployments to set the deployed versions to receive all traffic
        for their modules by default.

        To keep the old behavior (traffic split remains the same), use the
        `--no-promote` flag or run
        `gcloud config set app/promote_by_default true`.

        Note that your old versions are still running, and must be stopped
        manually. This behavior will change in a future release.

    *   Removed deprecated `--set-default` flag.  Please use `--promote`
        instead.

    *   `gcloud preview app deploy`: Removed deprecated `--env-vars` flag.

*   The output of the `gcloud preview app modules list` command has been
    changed to include the traffic split percentage instead of the 'default
    version' field.

*   Removed deprecated `gcloud preview app modules cancel-deployment` command.

    This command is no longer necessary due to recent improvements in the
    Deployment API.

*   Removed deprecated `gcloud preview app modules download` command.

    This command is no longer necessary due to recent improvements in the
    Deployment API.

*   Removed deprecated `gcloud preview app run` command. Please use
    `dev_appserver.py` instead.

*   Changed behavior of the `--zone`/`-z` flag in the `gcloud dns record-sets`
    command group. This flag can no longer precede the command. For instance,
    `gcloud dns record-sets -z=mz list` will not work, but
    `gcloud dns record-sets list -z=mz` will.

*   Changed `--password-file` option for `sql instances set-root-password`;
    password now does not include trailing newline from password file. This
    matches the documented behavior, but not the previous behavior.
    (Fixes https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=419)

*   Removed `meta/active_configuration` from the results of `gcloud config list`
    since it is not a property that can be set. You can continue to use the
    `gcloud config configurations` commands to view and manage your
    configurations.

### Cloud SDK

*   Added `gcloud config` proxy settings. Users can configure `gcloud` to use a
    proxy via the following settings:

    *   `gcloud config proxy/address`

    *   `gcloud config proxy/password`

    *   `gcloud config proxy/port`

    *   `gcloud config proxy/type`

    *   `gcloud config proxy/username`

*   Removed unused config properties: `app/hosted_registry`, `app/host`,
   `app/admin_host`, `app/api_host`.

### Google Cloud Logging

*   Migrated to
    [v2beta1](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/introduction_v2) API
    release.

    *   Moved `gcloud beta logging sinks` commands to `v2beta1`.

    *   Added `gcloud beta logging resource-descriptors` command to display
        supported resources from various services.

    *   Added `gcloud beta logging read` command to retrieve log entries using
        filters.

### Google Container Engine

*   Added `gcloud container clusters resize` for resizing Container Engine
    clusters.

*   Added notifications when node upgrades are available to `gcloud container
    cluster describe` and `list` commands.

### Google App Engine

*   Fixed bug where initial deployments using `--image-url` failed.

*   Changed `gcloud preview app modules set_default` command to use the App
    Engine Admin API.

*   Changed `gcloud preview app modules list` command to use the App Engine
    Admin API.

* `DEPLOYABLES` argument for `gcloud preview app deploy` is now optional. If not
   given, the command defaults to `app.yaml` in the current directory; if that
   is not found, it attempts to automatically generate necessary configuration
   files (such as app.yaml) in the current directory before deployment.
*  `--force` argument to `gcloud preview app deploy` is now deprecated and will
   be removed in a future release.

### Container

* `gcloud container` commands that poll long running operations (e.g create,
   delete, upgrade) now display progress details when available.


## 90.0.0 (2015/12/09)

* Cloud SDK release version scheme has changed. Patch version is now treated as
  a major release version which corresponds to SDK weekly releases.
  Any updates/fixes to released version will increment minor/patch version
  number going forward.

### Breaking Changes

* The deprecated flag --clear-target-pool has been removed from
  `gcloud compute instance-groups managed set-target-pools` command.

### Google App Engine

* Components updated to 1.9.30.
  Please visit the following release notes for details:
  * Python - https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/release-notes
  * Java - https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/release-notes
* Fixed a bug caused by uploading invalid file names for vm: true applications.

### Compute

* Subnetwork support has been promoted from alpha to beta. For more information
  see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/subnetworks.


## 0.9.89 (2015/12/02)

### Breaking Changes

*   Removed flag `--container-ipv4-cidr` for `gcloud container clusters create`;
    please use `--cluster-ipv4-cidr` instead.

*   Renamed `gcloud alpha compute vpn-tunnels create --ike-networks` to
    `--local-traffic-selector`.

*   `gcloud alpha compute resource-views` commands will soon be removed. Please
    use `gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged` commands instead.

*   `gcloud alpha compute replica-pools` commands will soon be removed. Please
    use `gcloud compute instance-groups` commands instead.

### `gcloud` Core

*   Changed behavior of `gcloud init` git repository clone option. It now takes
    as input a path to the destination directory for the repository,
    rather than the parent directory of the repository destination.

### BigQuery

*   Fixed failure in `gcloud alpha biquery query "select * from ..."` command
    while displaying query results.

### Compute

*   Fixed `gcloud alpha compute instances set-machine-type` failure when
    supplying custom cpu/custom memory, but no zone.

*   Added a new scope alias for Cloud Monitoring: `monitoring-write`. This scope
    is on by default in all new VMs.

### Google Cloud DNS

*   Added `--replace-origin-ns` flag to `gcloud dns record-sets import` command
    to allow importing NS records.

### Google Cloud Storage

*   Updated `gsutil` component to 4.16.

### Google Container Engine

*   Updated kubectl to version 1.1.2.

*   Increased `gcloud container clusters create/delete` timeouts from 20m to
    30m.

*   Added `--subnetwork` flag to `gcloud container clusters create` to allow
    creation of container clusters can now be created in a Google Compute Engine
    subnetwork (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/subnetworks).


## 0.9.88 (2015/11/25)

### Breaking Changes

* The `gcloud preview app run` command has now been removed. Please use the
  bundled `dev_appserver.py` script directly instead.

* App Engine: The 'version' and 'application' fields in module and configuration
  files are now illegal. Project name should instead be specified either by
  `gcloud config set project MY_PROJECT` or by setting the `--project` flag on
  individual command executions. Versions are generated automatically by default
  but can also be manually specified by setting the `--version` flag on
  individual command executions.

### App Engine

* Don't do runtime identification for custom runtimes during deploy. This fixes
  issue [#387](https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=387).

* The `dev_appserver.py` script no longer requires the installation of all App
  Engine components. It will install only the necessary ones at run time.
  Fixes [#273](https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=273)

### Core

* Added the `gcloud components install` command.  This allows you to install
  missing components at the version of the SDK you currently have (it does not
  update your SDK installation).  `gcloud components update` should now only be
  used to update your SDK to the latest version.

* Fixes [#293](https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=293)
  related SSL certificate validation issues.

* Use zsh builtins in path.zsh.inc for faster/cleaner shell startup.

## 0.9.87 (2015/11/18)

### Compute

* `gcloud alpha compute instances create` now supports --custom-cpu and
   --custom-memory flags to specify custom machine types.

### Dataproc

* Added `gcloud beta dataproc clusters diagnose` command. See
  <https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/support/diagnose-command> for more info.

### Google Container Engine

* Updated kubectl to version 1.1.1.

## 0.9.86 (2015/11/11)

### App Engine

* Generated node.js Dockerfiles now add the full application context before
  running install hooks.

* For Google App Engine Node.js runtimes, install requested version of node
  prior to doing an npm install.

### Compute

* `gcloud beta compute instances set-machine-type` has been promoted from alpha
  to beta,

## 0.9.85 (2015/11/04)

### Breaking Changes

* `gcloud alpha compute networks create` now requires --mode flag.

### App Engine

* Added the --output-directory option to gen-repo-info-file command. This option
  supersedes --output-file, which is deprecated and will be removed in a future
  release.

* Improved error message when specified yaml file is not found.

### Compute

* Launching `gcloud alpha compute networks subnets`.

* `gcloud compute alpha instance-templates` and `instances` now support
  subnetworks.

* New flag --ike-networks in `gcloud alpha compute vpn-tunnels create`.

* `gcloud compute ssh` now passes through the exit code of the ssh command. This
  fixes issue
  [#146 ](https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=146).

### Misc. Changes

* Gracefully handle socket timeouts while checking for Google Compute Engine
  metadata server. This fixes issue
  [#339](https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=339).

## 0.9.84 (2015/10/28)

### App Engine

* Due to PageSpeed service deprecation, user will receive a warning when
  deploying a new version to App Engine.

* Implemented fingerprinting support for Java.

* The gen-config flag now generates only app.yaml for the matching runtime by
  default, you must use the --custom flag to generate an app.yaml with a runtime
  of "custom" and Dockerfile (and other configs).

### Compute

* GA support for HTTPS load balancing features.

* Deprecated --clear-target-pool flag from compute instance-groups managed
  set-target-pools command.

### Windows support

* Windows Installer can now take a /logtofile flag to write installation logs to
  file CloudSDKInstall.log located in the same directory.

* Windows installer now displays an error message when the installation
  does not succeed.

### Command Line Interface support

* The [page=N] table format attribute prints one or more tables of at most N
  rows. Use this to view paged server data as it arrives at the client.

## 0.9.83 (2015/10/21)

### App Engine

* In a future release, the `gcloud preview app deploy` command will no longer
  support deploying multiple modules in the same invocation.

### Compute

* Ubuntu 14.10 is end of life: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases

* Fixed external issue
  [#291](https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=291),
  related to handling network addresses on Windows.

### Container Engine

* `gcloud container clusters list` now displays the current number of nodes
  for the cluster.

### Windows support

* When running Cloud SDK tools from PowerShell the `gcloud-ps.ps1` wrapper
  scripts now can be used which no longer call to `cmd.exe`. Using `gcloud-ps`,
  complex arguments can be passed without escaping for Windows command line.
  Using `gcloud`, the following command would be correctly escaped when running
  gcloud in PowerShell:

    gcloud fun --arg='"test ^< 123"'

  With the new `gcloud-ps`, the same command can be simply written as:

    gcloud-ps fun --arg='test < 123'

  Permissions to run PowerShell scripts must be given to PowerShell before these
  will work. Permissions can be changed with
  `"Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned"`.

## 0.9.82 (2015/10/14)

### App Engine

*   The App Engine Admin API is now the default path for deployments in the
    `gcloud preview app deploy` command. This transition should be transparent,
    but if you experience any issues and would like to revert to the old
    behavior, please run `gcloud config set app/use_appengine_api false`.

    See <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/> for more
    information about this API.

*   With `env: 2`, valid python runtimes are `python` and `python-compat`.

*   Implemented fingerprinting support for python.

### Container Engine

*   `gcloud container clusters create`: The flag `--container-ipv4-cidr` has
    been deprecated; `--cluster-ipv4-cidr` should be used instead.

### SQL

*   `gcloud beta sql operations describe` and `gcloud beta sql operations wait`
    no longer need `--instance` flag (`gcloud beta sql operations list` still
    does).

*   Fixed issue with `gcloud sql instances clone` when `--bin-log-file-name` and
    `--bin-log-position` are set.
    (<https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=201>).

## 0.9.81 (2015/10/07)

### Breaking Changes

*   If you are using a service account to run commands under
    `gcloud preview app`, you must enable the "App Engine Admin API" in the
    Developers Console (<https://console.developers.google.com>; navigate to
    **APIs and Auth > APIs**).

*   In a future Cloud SDK release, deployments that promote the new version to
    receive all traffic will stop the previous version by default.

    To keep the current behavior, pass the `--no-stop-previous-version`
    flag, or run the following command:

       $ gcloud config set app/stop_previous_version false

*   Removed `app get-resource-limits` command.

### App Engine

*   App Engine components updated to 1.9.27. Please see the following release
    notes for details:
    *   Python: <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/release-notes>
    *   Java: <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/release-notes>
*   The `gcloud preview app deploy` command now requires that users specify or
    omit the runtime: field from app.yaml if a Dockerfile is also specified.
*   The `gcloud preview app deploy` command now supports the "engines" field in
    package.json for node.js applications.

### Misc. Changes

*   Windows Installer has an option to run `gcloud init` after the installation
  finishes.

## 0.9.80 (2015/09/30)

*   `gcloud app`
    *   Soon, deployments will set the deployed version to receive all traffic
        by default.  To keep the current behavior, use the `--no-promote` flag
        or run the following command:

            $ gcloud config set app/promote_by_default false

        To adopt the new behavior early, use the `--promote` flag or run the
        following command:

            $ gcloud config set app/promote_by_default true

    *   The `--set-default` flag is deprecated. Please use the `--promote` flag
        instead.
    *   In a future Cloud SDK release, deployments that promote the new version
        to receive all traffic will stop the previous version by default.  To
        keep the current behavior, pass the `--no-stop-previous-version` flag,
        or run the following command:

            $ gcloud config set app/stop_previous_version true

    *   The `app run` command is deprecated and will soon be removed.  Please
        use dev_appserver (found in the same directory as the `gcloud command)
        instead.
    *   The `gcloud preview app modules download command` is deprecated, and
        will be removed soon.

*   The Windows installer has an option to run `gcloud init` after the
    installation finishes.
*   The `preview` component has been removed.
    *   The `gcloud preview app` commands remain available as usual and
        are still shipped through the `app` component.
    *   Please use `gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged` instead
        of `gcloud preview instance-groups`.  Note that you will need to
        modify some command invocations when switching to the non-preview
        commands.
    *   Please use `gcloud compute instance-groups managed` instead of
        `gcloud preview managed-instance-groups`.  Note that you will need to
        modify some command invocations when switching to the non-preview
        commands.
*   All Google Compute User Accounts commands have moved to beta.
*   Deployment-manager list commands now support pagination.
*   Minor bug fixes.

## 0.9.79 (2015/09/23)

*   The following commands have been promoted from beta to GA:
    *   gcloud config configurations ...
    *   gcloud source repos clone
    *   gcloud beta init. Old `gcloud init` behavior has been removed, and
        partially replaced by new gcloud init or directly via gcloud source
        repos clone.
*   Release gcloud beta dataproc.
*   The --env-vars flag in gcloud preview app deploy has been removed.
*   Automatic ssh key generation respects the --quiet flag.
*   The --format flag now supports extended format expressions. For details run
    $ gcloud topic formats.
*   Most commands now document the positive Boolean --FLAG form and accept
    --no-FLAG to disable. For the past few releases --log-http accepted an
    optional true/false value. It has been restored to its original definition
    of being a Boolean flag that has no value.
*   `gcloud sql` operations are now automatically retried for 2s in case of
    HttpException: The Cloud SQL instance operation does not exist.
*   Update gcloud's kubectl from 1.0.5 to 1.0.6.
*   Deprecate `gcloud preview app get-resource-limits`.

## 0.9.78 (2015/09/16)

*   App Engine components updated to 1.9.26. Please visit
    <https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/wiki/SdkReleaseNotes> for
    details.
*   Increase the default boot disk size for remote build VMs in
    `gcloud preview app deploy`.
*   The `--instance` flag to the `gcloud preview app modules set-managed-by`
    command now takes an instance name instead of an index.
*   The V1Beta4 API for sqladmin can now be accessed through the
    `gcloud beta sql` surface.
*   Usability enhancements for `gcloud beta init` and named configurations.

## 0.9.77 (2015/09/09)

*   gcloud preview logging is now gcloud beta logging.
*   Update kubectl to version 1.0.5
*   Windows Cloud SDK installer improvements:
    *   Now allows changing the installation mode. You can choose between a
        "current user" installation and an "all users" installation.
    *   Now has an uninstaller and writes "Add/Remove Programs" uninstall
        entries.
*   Removal of unsupported --env-vars argument from gcloud preview app deploy.
*   gcloud compute instance groups: Allow --named-ports flag to be empty and
    clean named ports in set-named-ports commands.
*   Change in gcloud compute backend-services: introduce new flag
    --instance-group which takes advantage of new Instance Groups API.

## 0.9.76 (2015/09/02)

*   Update gsutil component to 4.14.
*   Resource views commands have moved from preview to alpha. Please use `gcloud
    alpha compute resource-views` in place of `gcloud preview resource-views`.
*   Replica pool commands have moved from preview to alpha. Please use `gcloud
    alpha compute replica-pools` in place of `gcloud preview replica-pools`.
*   `gcloud beta source repo` was renamed to `gcloud beta source repos`
*   Created google-cloud-sdk-announce@googlegroups.com
    <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/google-cloud-sdk-announce> email group to

*   Add target size of managed instance group for "compute instance-groups
    managed list" command.
*   Fixed the removal of platform-specific components when running `gcloud
    components remove`.
*   Fixed a bug related to checking for SDK updates when the SDK is installed as
    root (like on Debian Compute Engine images).
    *   Affected users should now see less frequent update messages and overall
        improved gcloud performance
*   `gcloud preview app deploy` won't update local images automatically anymore.

## 0.9.75 (2015/08/26)

*   Container Engine
    *   Container Engine GA commands available under `gcloud container`.
    *   `gcloud beta container get-credentials` now takes cluster name as
        argument instead of `--cluster` flag for consistency with other
        commands.
    *   Added `gcloud alpha container clusters update <cluster>
        --cloud-monitoring=<val>` command.
*   New release notes are printed on upgrade. (This won't take effect until
    an upgrade from this version to a later version.)
*   New `gcloud alpha genomics variantsets export` command.
*   Commands promoted from `gcloud alpha` to `gcloud beta`:
    *    `gcloud beta config configurations ...`
    *    `gcloud beta sources clone`
*   Improvements in error reporting and default output formatting.


## 0.9.74 (2015/08/19)

*   New list and import commands under `gcloud alpha genomics variants`.
*   Removed `--remote` flag. Instead, please use the `--docker-build=remote`
    flag (or use `--docker-build=local` to force a local build).
*   In this release, Docker builds are hosted by default. To opt-in to the old
    behavior, please use the `--docker-build=local` flag.


## 0.9.73 (2015/08/12)

*   gcloud sql instances create default to MySQL 5.6
*   gcloud beta container get-credentials renamed to gcloud beta container
    clusters get-credentials
*   New commands
    *   gcloud beta projects ...
    *   gcloud alpha genomics callsets ...
    *   gcloud beta emulators datastore ...
    *   gcloud beta container get-server-config
    *   gcloud alpha config configurations


## 0.9.72 (2015/08/05)

*   gcloud compute
    *   initial surface changes for the backend-bucket.
    *   `instance-groups set-named-ports`: introduced a new flag
        `--named-ports NAME:PORT,[NAME:PORT,...]` - no need to specify names
        and ports in separate flags.
*   gcloud preview app deploy
    Deprecate `--remote` flag in preparation for hosted Docker builds by
    default. Instead, please use the `--docker-build={remote,local}` flag.
    The default is still a local Docker build; in two releases, the default
    will switch to a hosted build.
*   New gcloud alpha genomics operations {list, cancel, describe} commands


## 0.9.71 (2015/07/29)

*   Launching `gcloud alpha pubsub` commands.

    disks.
*   Beta launch of customer supplied encryption keys for Compute Engine.
*   Updated kubectl to 1.0.1.
*   `gcloud alpha container` commands now target Container Engine v1 API.
    Options for `gcloud alpha container clusters create` updated accordingly:
    *   `--user` renamed to `--username`
    *   `--cluster-api-version` removed. Cluster version is not selectable in v1
        API; new clusters always created at latest supported version.
    *   `--image` option removed. Source image not selectable in v1 API;
        clusters are always created with latest supported ContainerVM image.
        Note that using an unsupported image (i.e. not ContainerVM) would
        result in an unusable cluster in most cases anyway.
    *   Added `--no-enable-cloud-monitoring` to turn off cloud monitoring
        (on by default).
    *   Added `--disk-size` option for specifying boot disk size of node vms.
*   App Engine components updated to 1.9.24. Please visit
    <https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/wiki/SdkReleaseNotes> for
    details.

    For several months on the Managed VMs team we've been testing a new mode of
    `dockerless` local development on gcloud that makes developing a module for
    Python, Java and Go users similar to development of regular App Engine
    applications. This new mode relaxes the sandbox constraints present in the
    devappserver for `vm: false` applications, and does not require Docker to be
    installed.

    You can currently opt-into this behavior by setting GAE_LOCAL_VM_RUNTIME=1;
    In this release of the Cloud SDK, we will be making this behavior the
    default for Managed VM users who are using gcloud.

    You can still opt-out of this behavior by setting: GAE_LOCAL_VM_RUNTIME=0.

    For custom runtime users, if you are relying on the local Development Server
    to build your application, will now need to pass the `--custom-entrypoint`
    flag to `gcloud preview app run` to provide gcloud with the correct
    command to call.

    This does not affect users developing for non-managed VMs, or for users who
    are not using gcloud."
*   Bug fixes for:
    *   `gcloud preview app deploy` file paths issue on Windows.
    *   `gcloud compute instance-groups managed wait-until-stable` periodic user
        prompting for target zone.


## 0.9.70 (2015/07/22)

*   Add `gcloud compute instance-groups` commands.
*   Move `gcloud beta deployment-manager` commands to general availability as
    `gcloud deployment-manager` and update to use the v2beta3 API. This change
    does not alter the gcloud surface for users of the deployment-manager
    component.
*   Update kubectl to 1.0.0.
*   `gcloud alpha genomics` commands now use the genomics V1 API. The
    --project-number flag for `dataset create` and `dataset list` is now
    obsolete. The configured --project-id is used instead and can be overridden
    with the --project-id flag.
*   Fix hang on errors in `gcloud preview app deploy`.

## 0.9.69 (2015/07/15)

*   Update kubectl to 0.20.2.
*   Fix an authentication issue with 'gcloud docker' affecting docker version
    1.7.0 and later.

*   Remove `gcloud preview deployment-manager` command group
    (`gcloud beta deployment-manager` still exists; see
    <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/#install-version> if you want to pin your
    installation to an old version).
*   Bug fixes.

## 0.9.68 (2015/07/08)

*   Deprecated gcutil tool is no longer distributed with Cloud SDK.
    It is still available via <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcutil>.
*   Added support for Container engine BETA commands under the
    `gcloud beta container` command group.  Existing `gcloud alpha container`
    commands are unchanged.
*   The standalone App Engine SDKs are no longer distributed through the Cloud
    SDK.
    *    App Engine functionality can still be used through the
        `gcloud preview app` command group.
    *    The gae-java, gae-python, gae-php, and gae-go components no longer
         exist in the component manager.
    *    If you need to use appcfg or dev_appserver directly, these are still
         available in the App Engine SDK downloads that can be found here:
         <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads>
*   Bug fixes.

## 0.9.67 (2015/07/01)

*   App Engine components updated to 1.9.23. Please visit
    <https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/wiki/SdkReleaseNotes> for
    details.

    files for node.js apps.
*   New `compute instance-groups unmanaged` commands group for Instance Groups
    which are not managed by Instance Group Manager
*   Moved `gcloud beta sql instances connect` to `gcloud beta sql connect`.
*   Smarter polling while waiting for SQL operations to finish, reducing the
    number of requests sent to the server.
*   Linux/Mac install script disables prompts if there is no controlling tty.
*   Linux/Mac install script now properly detects zsh and ksh RC files.
*   Bug fixes.

## 0.9.64 (2015/06/10)

*   New commands
    *   `gcloud beta compute scp` for secure copy.
    *   `gcloud alpha genomics` commands (on datasets).
    *   `gcloud alpha source list` to lists project repositories.
*   kubectl will no longer be installed by default.
*   Bug fixes for HTTPS load balancing.
