    Please visit the following release notes for details:
    <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/release-notes>.
*   Added support for deploying Standard Environment Java applications to
    `gcloud beta app deploy`; use either `gcloud beta app deploy
    $APP_DIR/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml` or `gcloud beta app deploy $APP_DIR`.
*   Added support for directories as positional arguments to `gcloud app
    deploy`, in addition to YAML files. In each directory, the command uses the
    `app.yaml` file if present, or interactively creates one otherwise.

### Google Cloud Dataproc

*   Promoted `--region` flag to beta and GA for every `gcloud dataproc` command.
    The flag remains available in alpha and is identical.
*   Added URL support for zonal resource flags `--zone`,
    `--master-machine-type`, `--worker-machine-type`,
    `--master-accelerator-type`, and `--worker-accelerator-type` in `gcloud
    dataproc` commands in addition to short names; for instance,
    `https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/zones/us-central1-f` as
    well as `us-central1-f`.

    to support the application of labels to SQL instances.

### Google Compute Engine

*   Added `--source-instance-template` flag to `gcloud beta compute instances
    <create|create-from-container>` to allow instance creation based on an
    instance template (see `gcloud compute instance-templates` command group).
*   Added `--ssl-certificates` flag to `gcloud alpha compute
    <target-https-proxies|target-ssl-proxies> <create|update>` to allow the
    specification of multiple ssl certificates when creating or updating a
    target proxy.
*   Added for option `STANDARD` for
    *   `--network-interface` sub-flag `network-tier` in
        `gcloud alpha compute instances create` and
        `gcloud alpha compute instances <create|create-from-container>`
    *   `--network-tier` flag in
        `gcloud alpha compute instances
        <create|add-access-config|update-access-config>`, `gcloud alpha compute
        instance-templates <create|create-from-container>`, and `gcloud alpha
        compute <addresses|forwarding-rules> create`.
*   Added command `gcloud beta compute addresses update` for
    modification of addresses (in particular, modifying labels).
*   Added command `gcloud beta compute forwarding-rules update` for
    modification of forwarding rules (in particular, modifying labels).
*   Promoted flag `--force-create` of `gcloud compute images create` to beta.
    By default, image creation fails when it is created from a disk that is
    attached to a running instance. When this flag is used, image creation from
    disk will proceed even if the disk is in use.

### Google Container Engine

*   Promoted `gcloud container node-pools rollback` command to GA. The alpha
    and beta command remains available and is identical.
*   Added `--enable-network-policy` flag to `gcloud alpha container clusters
    <create|update>` to enable network policy enforcement.

## 160.0.0 (2017-06-21; abandoned: all changes available in 161.0.0)

### Breaking Changes

*   Removed the deprecated `gcloud ml-engine init-project` command. It is no
    longer needed by other Google Cloud ML Engine commands.

### Google Cloud SDK

*   GA cmdlets for Stackdriver Logging, Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Google Cloud IAM
    are now available in Cloud Tools for PowerShell.

### Google App Engine

*   `gcloud beta app deploy` now uses the new PHP Runtime Builder pipeline to
    deploy apps. The normal `gcloud app deploy` remains unchanged.
*   Previously, `gcloud app` list commands would only show the first 50 results.
    Now, all relevant results will be shown.

### Google Compute Engine

*   It is now supported to delete both zonal and regional Managed Instance
    Groups in one `gcloud` invocation.
*   Using labels in `gcloud` for the following Google Compute Engine resources
    is now in GA: disks, images, instances, and snapshots.

### Google Cloud Container Builder

*   Fixed a bug affecting concurrent invocations of `gcloud container builds
    submit` wherein objects could be uploaded to the same location,
    resulting in collisions and corrupted/broken builds.

### Google Cloud Video Intelligence

*   The `gcloud ml video` command group is now available in the beta track.
    These commands allow you to use the Cloud Video Intelligence API to analyze
    videos and manage long-running video analysis operations.

## 159.0.0 (2017-06-14)

### Google App Engine

*   Added commands to support automatically managed certificates:
    *   `gcloud alpha app domain-mappings`
    *   `gcloud alpha app ssl-certificates`
*   Added `--no-launch-browser` flag to all `gcloud app browse` commands:
    *   Allows the user to specify that they don't want a browser, they just
        want the url.
    *   Detects situations that the user probably can't launch a browser (no
        DISPLAY, etc.) and just prints the URL instead of attempting to launch
        a browser.

### Google Cloud Bigtable

*   `cbt ls <table>` now shows the GC policy for each column family.

### Google Compute Engine

*   Added `gcloud compute instances set-service-account`
*   `gcloud compute disks snapshot` now waits for the operation to finish
    indefinitely.
*   Removed the `--zone` flag in:
    *   `gcloud compute backend-services add-backend`
    *   `gcloud compute backend-services remove-backend`
    *   `gcloud compute backend-services update-backend`
*   Removed the `--region` flag in:
    *   `gcloud functions` command group (alpha and beta)
    *   `gcloud functions regions list`
*   Promoted Google cloud TCP proxy to GA.
    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/tcp-ssl/tcp-proxy

### Google Container Registry

    docker-credential-gcr.

### Google Cloud KMS

*   Promoted KMS `gcloud kms encrypt` and `gcloud kms decrypt` commands from
    beta to GA.

## 158.0.0 (2017-06-07)

### Breaking Changes

*   The App Engine Go externalized runtime will detect Go apps using only the
    files in the root of the app directory. This means that
    `gcloud beta app gen-config` (and `gcloud app deploy` in an app directory
    with no app.yaml file) will not recognize a Go runtime if .go files are in
    subdirectories. To override this behavior, run
    `gcloud beta app gen-config --runtime go` to generate an app.yaml with the
    Go runtime.

### Google App Engine

*   `gcloud beta app deploy` now uses the new Ruby Runtime Builder pipeline to
     deploy apps. The normal `gcloud app deploy` remains unchanged.

### Google Cloud Bigtable Emulator

*    Fixes compatibility with latest HBase client library.
*    Performance improvements for large bulk mutations.

### Google Cloud SQL

*    `gcloud sql instances patch` commands will stop asking for confirmation
      that existing networks have been included in case of authorized networks
      being updated, unless the `--authorized-networks` flag is being used.

### Google Compute Engine

*     POTENTIALLY BREAKING: Most `gcloud compute` commands that involve
      specifying instances will now only prompt with relevant zones and no
      longer show all Google Cloud Platform zones when the `--zone` flag is
      omitted.
*     gcloud shared VPC network (XPN) commands are now in GA.

## 157.0.0 (2017-05-31)

### Google Cloud SDK

*   Added the auth/disable_credentials property that allows gcloud to
    make requests without loading credentials. This is only useful if you are
    behind a proxy that adds authentication to your requests automatically.
*   Cloud Tools for PowerShell:
    *   Added BigQuery beta cmdlets to manage BigQuery datasets.
    *   Added Container beta cmdlets to manage Container clusters.

### Google App Engine

*   Added command `gcloud beta app instances scp` for securely copying files
    between an App Engine Flexible instance and the local machine.
*   Updated App Engine components to 1.9.54.

### Google Compute Engine

*   Added ability to set the min-cpu-platform of an instance or
    instance-template in beta.

### Google Cloud Bigquery

*   gcloud config set proxy/* settings are now propagated to bq.

    this group manage IoT devices and data.

### Google Cloud Datalab

*   Updated the `datalab` component to the 20170525 release. Changes in this
    release are documented in its tracking issue
    [here](https://github.com/googledatalab/datalab/issues/1385).

### Google Cloud Container Engine

*   Updated Google Container Engine's kubectl from version 1.6.3 to 1.6.4.

### Google Cloud ML Engine

*   Removed `gcloud beta ml` alias for `gcloud beta ml-engine`
    commands. Please use `gcloud ml-engine` directly.
*   Removed `gcloud ml-engine models versions` group in favor of the identical
    `gcloud ml-engine versions` group.
*   `gcloud ml-engine` commands in the beta track now run
    against the `v1` API, since the `v1beta1` API is turning down.
    These changes do not affect `gcloud ml` commands for Google Cloud Natural
    Language, Google Cloud Speech, or Google Cloud Vision.

### Google Cloud SQL

*   Promoted `gcloud sql connect` to GA.

### Google Cloud KMS

*   Added `encrypt` and `decrypt` commands to `gcloud beta kms`.

## 156.0.0 (2017-05-24)

### Breaking Changes

*   `gcloud container builds submit` will host build logs in a bucket owned
    by the Container Builder team by default, rather than one owned by the
    customer. If the customer does specify a bucket,
    The command `gcloud container builds submit` will no longer create that
    bucket if it does not already exist.

*   `gcloud sql instances set-root-password` is now deprecated and will be
    removed in version 162.0.0. Please use `gcloud sql users set-password`
    as an alternative.

*   `gcloud computes copy-files` is now deprecated. Use `gcloud compute scp`
    instead. Note that recursive copy is not turned on by default for `scp`.
    Add `--recurse` to the invocation to turn it on.

*   The ISO time string format for the `DUE_TIME` argument to retrieve a backup
    in `gcloud beta sql backups describe` is now deprecated in favor of
    integer format (now known as the `ID` argument). Instead of running:

    $ gcloud beta sql backups describe 2017-05-24T00:00:00.000Z --instance a1

    please run:

    $ gcloud beta sql backups describe 1490238000769 --instance a1

### Google App Engine

    instead of `nsenter` in order to attach to container. The `--container`
    flag can be used with any VM instance that has docker installed.

*   Promoted Identity-Aware Proxy support to the GA release track for
    `gcloud compute backend-services`.

*   Add the `suse-sap-cloud` project to the default public image list.

    that include game test loops. You run tests as follows:

      $ gcloud beta firebase test android run --type game-loop ...

    To learn more, see https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/game-loop.

*   Added support for network shaping to alpha and beta release tracks
    for Firebase Test Lab. You can add a network profile to your tests with
    the `--network-profile` flag, followed by the name of the network profile
    you would like to use. Firebase Test Lab provides information about the
    network profiles available for network shaping through the `list` and
    `describe` commands. You can use them as follows:

    Engine disk resources.

### Google Cloud SQL

*   Starting on 2017-06-30, the `--instance` flag in `gcloud sql operations
    wait` and `gcloud sql operations describe` will no longer be supported. You
    can still run the same command by omitting this flag.

### Google Cloud Containers

*   Added the `--start-ip-rotation` and `--complete-ip-rotation` flags to
    `gcloud container clusters update`.
*   Improved the performance of `gcloud container images list-tags` in certain
    cases.

### Miscellaneous

*   (Cloud Bigtable Emulator) The Cloud Bigtable Emulator no longer crashes when
    not configured with a host_port.
*   (Cloud SDK) Fixed a bug in the fish shell $PATH script that caused the $PWD

    `gcloud compute {instances,instance-templates} create{,-from-container}`
    commands in the alpha track.

### Google Service Management

*   Added `gcloud service-management operations list` command in the alpha and
    beta tracks.


## 150.0.0 (2017-04-05)

### Breaking Changes

*   The v1beta1 API for Google Cloud ML Engine is deprecated and will be turned
    off on 2017-05-31. Please switch to the `gcloud ml-engine` commands, which
    use the v1 API, by that date; at that time, the `gcloud beta ml-engine`
    commands will switch over to the v1 API.

### Cloud Tools for PowerShell

*   Added beta cmdlets for Google Container Engine.
*   Fixed a bug where `Get-GcdChange` and `Get-GcdResourceRecordSet` were not
    returning more than 1000 items.

### Google App Engine

*   Fixed an issue in `gcloud app operations list` which resulted in sporadic
    crashes.

### Google Compute Engine

*   Added Google Cloud TCP proxy commands to the Beta track. For more
    information see `gcloud beta compute target-tcp-proxies` group and the
    online documentation:
    *   https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/tcp-ssl/tcp-proxy

### Google Container Engine

*   `gcloud container clusters create|get-credentials` will now configure
    kubectl to use the credentials of the active gcloud account by default,
    instead of using application default credentials. This requires kubectl
    1.6.0 or higher. You can update kubectl by running
    `gcloud components update kubectl`.
    If you prefer to use application default credentials to authenticate kubectl
    to Google Container Engine clusters, you can revert to the previous behavior
    by setting the `container/use_application_default_credentials` property:
    *   `gcloud config set container/use_application_default_credentials true`
    *   `export CLOUDSDK_CONTAINER_USE_APPLICATION_DEFAULT_CREDENTIALS=true`
*   Added `--[no-]enable-legacy-abac` option to
    `gcloud container clusters create` and `gcloud container clusters update`.
    For more details see online documentation:
    *   https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/role-based-access-control
*   Added `--set-password` and `--generate-password` options to the
    `gcloud container cluster update` command.
*   Modified the `gcloud container images list-tags` command to consider 10
    recent images by default, instead of all.
*   Updated Google Container Engine's kubectl from version 1.5.4 to 1.6.0.

### Google Cloud IAM

*   Added tab completion to `gcloud iam service-accounts` commands.

### Google Cloud Logging

*   Removed deprecated "unique-writer-identity" flag. All created/updated sinks
    will use custom service accounts to increase security.
    Please see documentation for more details:
    *   https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2#destination_authorization
*   Remove support for creating/updating sinks with legacy V1 format.

### Google Cloud Resource Manager

*   Updated `gcloud projects set-iam-policy` and
    `gcloud organizations set-iam-policy` commands to allow users to edit audit
    configs. Changes to IAM policy should be handled via a read-modify-write
    command sequence.

### Google Cloud Storage

*   Update gsutil component to 4.24.

### Google Cloud SQL

*   Added `gcloud beta sql instances set-root-password` for consistency with
    the GA set of commands.
    This command is deprecated in favor of `gcloud beta sql users set-password`.

### Google Cloud Source Repositories

*   `gcloud source repos` command group promoted to Beta track.

### Emulators

*   Datastore emulator now defaults to port 8081, and pubsub emulator to 8085.

### Breaking Changes

*   The Cloud SDK installer on `*nix` will no longer attempt to update your RC
    files in non-interactive mode.
*   Support for creating/updating legacy sinks has been removed from
    `gcloud beta logging`.

### Cloud SDK

*   SHA256 checksums, instead of SHA1 checksums, are now being published for
    Cloud SDK versioned archives and other downloadable assets.

### Firebase Test Lab

*   The `gcloud test` commands have been promoted to GA and renamed
    `gcloud firebase test ...`.  All `gcloud beta test ...` commands are
    deprecated.
*   The preferred way to specify test devices is the new `--device` argument,
    which allows more precise control over which device dimensions are included
    in a test matrix. See `gcloud firebase test android run --help` and
    `gcloud topic arg-files` for details.

### Google App Engine

*   Updated Python SDK to version 1.9.51.
*   Support Server Name Indication (SNI) for remote API shell.

### Google Cloud Datalab

*   Update the datalab component to the 20170323 build. With this release, the
    entire `/content` directory of newly created instances will be persisted to
    the attached disk rather than just the `/content/datalab` directory.

### Google Cloud Natural Language

*   The `gcloud beta ml language` command group is now available. Use commands
    in this group to analyze text with the Natural Language API. For more
    information, see: https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/.

### Google Cloud Runtime Configuration

*   The optional flag `--values` has been added to
    `gcloud beta runtime-config configs variables list`; it can be used to
    return values along with variables.

### Google Cloud SQL

*   Argument validation for instance arguments has been added to
   `gcloud beta sql instances create`, `gcloud sql instances create`, and
   `gcloud sql instances set-root-password`

### Google Compute Engine

*   `gcloud alpha compute ssh` can now connect to instances using private IP
    addresses.
*   `gcloud alpha compute images create` now has a `--force-creation` flag.

### Google Container Engine

*   `gcloud container images delete` has been modified to delete the underlying
    image, and all associated tags, when given a tag reference. For the
    remainder of beta, `--resolve-tag-to-digest` will be required when deleting
    an image by tag, to avoid accidental deletion. This will become default
    behavior when the command graduates from beta.


## 148.0.1 (2017-03-24)

### Google Cloud Functions

*   Fixed a bug where `gcloud beta functions deploy` did not work without the
    `--region` flag specified.


## 148.0.0 (2017-03-22)

### Breaking Changes

*   The `gcloud ml-engine jobs submit training`
    command is now asynchronous by default; pass `--stream-logs` to get the
    old behavior.
*   `gcloud ml-engine local predict` now only supports
    prediction using models in SavedModel format. For details, see:
    https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/saved_model/README.md

### Cloud SDK

*   Windows users upgrading to the new version might see an error after
    running `gcloud components update`. This is because the update modifies
    the gcloud.cmd file. The update should have finished successfully
    regardless of the error. To make sure, run `gcloud components update`
    again. It should say it's already up to date.

### Google Cloud BigQuery

*   Added support for updating field descriptions on query destination table.
    See the `destination_schema` flag within the `query` command.
*   Added support for showing only a subset of selected table fields.
    See the `selected_fields` flag within the `head` command.
*   Added support for setting labels on tables.
    See the `label` flag within the `mk` command.

### Google Cloud Datalab

*   Updated the datalab component to the 20170316 build.
    This release includes two bug fixes in how the tool looks up
    Datalab instances:

    1. No longer prompt for a zone if the specified instance does not exist.
    2. Report an error if the specified instance was not created by the tool.

### Deployment Manager

*   Promote `gcloud alpha deployment-manager` commands to the beta
    release track.

### Google Cloud ML Engine

*   The default log polling interval for logs has been raised;
    this should prevent streaming from using too much quota.

### Google Container Engine

*   Update Google Container Engine's kubectl from version 1.5.3 to 1.5.4.

### Google Container Registry

*   `untag` has been added to the `container images` command group. In the
    future, `container images delete` will be modified to delete the underlying
    image (and all associated tags) and this will be the primary method of
    removing tags from images.

### Google Service Management

*   `--validate-only` flag added to `service-management deploy` command

### Google Cloud Key Management Service

*   `gcloud beta kms` commands have been promoted to general availability
     as `gcloud kms`.

*   Update gsutil component to 4.23


## 147.0.0 (2017-03-15)

### Breaking Changes

*   Modified argument parsing for commands that pass arguments through to
    another program.
    The `--` argument must be specified between gcloud specific args on the
    left and the rest of the command on the right.
    Commands will no longer allow the omission of the `--`, and unparsed
    arguments will not be treated as implementation args.
*   Made the `--config-name` flag mandatory for
    `runtime-config configs variables` and `runtime-config configs waiters`
    commands.
*   Renamed `gcloud kms cryptokeys` as `gcloud kms keys`.
    Renamed the `--cryptokey` flag as `--key`.
    Deprecated the `cryptokey` variants.
*   Modified `alpha source repos clone` to produce an error message if the
    repository being cloned is a mirror. The command no longer asks to create
    the repo if it does not exist.

### Cloud SDK

*   The gcloud interactive shell auto completes gcloud commands and flags, and
    displays help, as command lines are typed into the shell.
    Run `gcloud alpha shell` to launch the shell.

### Google Compute Engine

*   Promoted custom cache keys to beta.
*   Promoted `gcloud compute networks subnets` to beta.

### Google App Engine

*   Modified Google App Engine Flexible Environment runtimes that
    require `entrypoint:` to automatically prepend `exec` to
    entrypoints, to ensure signals are passed through to the application
    process.
*   Java SDK updated to 1.9.50. For more details, please see
    *   https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/release-notes

    client versions of 17.03.xx and above.

### Firebase Test Lab

*   Added new `--results-dir` flag for the `gcloud test android run` command
    to specify a predetermined storage location for test results. The value
    must be unique per each test matrix created. This avoids the need to parse
    stderr to find the path to the raw test results.
*   Added new commands `beta test android versions describe` and
    `beta test android locales describe`.

### Google Cloud Key Management Service (Beta)

*   Tab completion for the Cloud KMS --location flag is now supported.

    runtime-config`. All commands previously under `gcloud beta runtime-configs`
    have been moved to the `gcloud beta runtime-config configs` command group.

### Google App Engine

*   `gcloud app deploy` now deploys Go apps for both Standard and Flexible
    environments. All usage of `aedeploy` can now use `gcloud app deploy`
    directly instead.
*   When passing a directory to dev_appserver.py, dev_appserver.py searches for
    yaml in the directory so that gcloud can check missing components and prompt
    to install.

  enabled for users who have opted in during installation.

### Google Cloud Datalab

* Update the datalab command line tool to the 20170208 build.
  This update includes the following changes:
  1. All subcommands of the `datalab` tool now support a `--quiet` flag for
     disabling interactive prompts.
  2. You can now configure the logging threshold for messages that Datalab
     instances write to StackDriver logging. The default is `warn`, but
     this can be overridden by passing in the `--log-level` flag.
  3. The `datalab create` and `datalab connect` commands are more intelligent
     about when they should open a browser. In particular, they detect if
     the configured browser is a text-only browser or if the command is
     being run from inside of Google Cloud Shell, and do not attempt to
     launch the browser in those cases.
  4. The tool will now detect and warn if two users try to share a single
     Datalab instance, as that use case is not supported.
  5. Newly created Datalab instances use the Container Optimized OS
     rather than the older Container VM OS.

### Google Cloud Functions

  kind)')"`

* Added list field aggregation formatting (similar to nested formatting) by
  `--format="table(listField2:format=FORMAT-STRING)"`. When the main table
  has no columns each nested format is aggregated into a single list.
  Try: `gcloud compute instances list
  --format="table(disks:format='table[box](deviceName:sort=1, kind)')"`

## 94.0.0 (2016/1/27)

*   Because of the rollback of 91.0.0, this release contains all of the changes
    from 91.0.0 in addition to the changes listed below.

### Breaking Changes

*   `gcloud preview app deploy`

    *   Changed deployments to set the deployed versions to receive all traffic
        for their modules by default.

        To keep the old behavior (traffic split remains the same), use the
        `--no-promote` flag or run
        `gcloud config set app/promote_by_default true`.

        Note that your old versions are still running, and must be stopped
        manually. This behavior will change in a future release.

    *   Removed deprecated `--set-default` flag.  Please use `--promote`
        instead.

    *   `gcloud preview app deploy`: Removed deprecated `--env-vars` flag.

*   The output of the `gcloud preview app modules list` command has been
    changed to include the traffic split percentage instead of the 'default
    version' field.

*   Removed deprecated `gcloud preview app modules cancel-deployment` command.

    This command is no longer necessary due to recent improvements in the
    Deployment API.

*   Removed deprecated `gcloud preview app modules download` command.

    This command is no longer necessary due to recent improvements in the
    Deployment API.

*   Removed deprecated `gcloud preview app run` command. Please use
    `dev_appserver.py` instead.

*   Changed behavior of the `--zone`/`-z` flag in the `gcloud dns record-sets`
    command group. This flag can no longer precede the command. For instance,
    `gcloud dns record-sets -z=mz list` will not work, but
    `gcloud dns record-sets list -z=mz` will.

*   Changed `--password-file` option for `sql instances set-root-password`;
    password now does not include trailing newline from password file. This
    matches the documented behavior, but not the previous behavior.
    (Fixes https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35906498)

*   Removed `meta/active_configuration` from the results of `gcloud config list`
    since it is not a property that can be set. You can continue to use the
    `gcloud config configurations` commands to view and manage your
    configurations.

### Cloud SDK

*   Added `gcloud config` proxy settings. Users can configure `gcloud` to use a
    proxy via the following settings:

    *   `gcloud config proxy/address`

    *   `gcloud config proxy/password`

    *   `gcloud config proxy/port`

    *   `gcloud config proxy/type`

    *   `gcloud config proxy/username`

*   Added `alpha` and `beta` components to Debian packages.

*   Removed unused config properties: `app/hosted_registry`, `app/host`,
   `app/admin_host`, `app/api_host`.

### Google Cloud Logging

*   Migrated to
    [v2beta1](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/introduction_v2) API
    release.

    *   Moved `gcloud beta logging sinks` commands to `v2beta1`.

    *   Added `gcloud beta logging resource-descriptors` command to display
        supported resources from various services.

    *   Added `gcloud beta logging read` command to retrieve log entries using
        filters.

### Google Container Engine

*   Added `gcloud container clusters resize` for resizing Container Engine
    clusters.

*   Added notifications when node upgrades are available to `gcloud container
    cluster describe` and `list` commands.

### Google App Engine

*   Fixed bug where initial deployments using `--image-url` failed.

*   Changed `gcloud preview app modules set_default` command to use the App
    Engine Admin API.

*   Changed `gcloud preview app modules list` command to use the App Engine
    Admin API.

* App Engine API is now the only supported method for deploying in the
  `gcloud preview app deploy` command.

### Google App Engine

* `DEPLOYABLES` argument for `gcloud preview app deploy` is now optional. If not
   given, the command defaults to `app.yaml` in the current directory; if that
   is not found, it attempts to automatically generate necessary configuration
   files (such as app.yaml) in the current directory before deployment.
*  `--force` argument to `gcloud preview app deploy` is now deprecated and will
   be removed in a future release.

### Container

* `gcloud container` commands that poll long running operations (e.g create,
   delete, upgrade) now display progress details when available.


## 90.0.0 (2015-12-09)

* Cloud SDK release version scheme has changed. Patch version is now treated as
  a major release version which corresponds to SDK weekly releases.
  Any updates/fixes to released version will increment minor/patch version
  number going forward.

    `--local-traffic-selector`.

*   `gcloud alpha compute resource-views` commands will soon be removed. Please
    use `gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged` commands instead.

*   `gcloud alpha compute replica-pools` commands will soon be removed. Please
    use `gcloud compute instance-groups` commands instead.

### `gcloud` Core

*   Changed behavior of `gcloud init` git repository clone option. It now takes
    as input a path to the destination directory for the repository,
    rather than the parent directory of the repository destination.

### BigQuery

*   Fixed failure in `gcloud alpha biquery query "select * from ..."` command
    while displaying query results.

### Compute

*   Fixed `gcloud alpha compute instances set-machine-type` failure when
    supplying custom cpu/custom memory, but no zone.

    creation of container clusters can now be created in a Google Compute Engine
    subnetwork (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/subnetworks).


## 0.9.88 (2015-11-25)

### Breaking Changes

* The `gcloud preview app run` command has now been removed. Please use the
  bundled `dev_appserver.py` script directly instead.

* App Engine: The 'version' and 'application' fields in module and configuration
  files are now illegal. Project name should instead be specified either by
  `gcloud config set project MY_PROJECT` or by setting the `--project` flag on
  individual command executions. Versions are generated automatically by default
  but can also be manually specified by setting the `--version` flag on
  individual command executions.

### App Engine

* Don't do runtime identification for custom runtimes during deploy. This fixes
  issue [#387](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35906466).

* The `dev_appserver.py` script no longer requires the installation of all App
  Engine components. It will install only the necessary ones at run time.
  Fixes [#273](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35906352)

### Core

* Added the `gcloud components install` command.  This allows you to install
  missing components at the version of the SDK you currently have (it does not
  update your SDK installation).  `gcloud components update` should now only be
  used to update your SDK to the latest version.

* Fixes [#293](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35906372) related SSL
  certificate validation issues.

### App Engine

* Due to PageSpeed service deprecation, user will receive a warning when
  deploying a new version to App Engine.

* Implemented fingerprinting support for Java.

* The gen-config flag now generates only app.yaml for the matching runtime by
  default, you must use the --custom flag to generate an app.yaml with a runtime
  of "custom" and Dockerfile (and other configs).

### Compute

* GA support for HTTPS load balancing features.

* Deprecated --clear-target-pool flag from compute instance-groups managed
  set-target-pools command.

### Windows support

* Windows Installer can now take a /logtofile flag to write installation logs to
  file CloudSDKInstall.log located in the same directory.

* Windows installer now displays an error message when the installation
  does not succeed.

### Command Line Interface support

* The [page=N] table format attribute prints one or more tables of at most N
  rows. Use this to view paged server data as it arrives at the client.

## 0.9.83 (2015-10-21)

### App Engine

* In a future release, the `gcloud preview app deploy` command will no longer
  support deploying multiple modules in the same invocation.

### Compute

* Ubuntu 14.10 is end of life: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases

* Fixed external issue [#291](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35906370),
  related to handling network addresses on Windows.

### Container Engine

* `gcloud container clusters list` now displays the current number of nodes
  for the cluster.

### Windows support

* When running Cloud SDK tools from PowerShell the `gcloud-ps.ps1` wrapper
  scripts now can be used which no longer call to `cmd.exe`. Using `gcloud-ps`,
  complex arguments can be passed without escaping for Windows command line.
  Using `gcloud`, the following command would be correctly escaped when running
  gcloud in PowerShell:

    gcloud fun --arg='"test ^< 123"'

  With the new `gcloud-ps`, the same command can be simply written as:

    gcloud-ps fun --arg='test < 123'

  Permissions to run PowerShell scripts must be given to PowerShell before these
  will work. Permissions can be changed with
  `"Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned"`.

## 0.9.82 (2015-10-14)

### App Engine

*   The App Engine Admin API is now the default path for deployments in the
    `gcloud preview app deploy` command. This transition should be transparent,
    but if you experience any issues and would like to revert to the old
    behavior, please run `gcloud config set app/use_appengine_api false`.

    See <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/> for more
    information about this API.

*   With `env: 2`, valid python runtimes are `python` and `python-compat`.

*   Implemented fingerprinting support for python.

### Container Engine

*   `gcloud container clusters create`: The flag `--container-ipv4-cidr` has
    been deprecated; `--cluster-ipv4-cidr` should be used instead.

### SQL

*   `gcloud beta sql operations describe` and `gcloud beta sql operations wait`
    no longer need `--instance` flag (`gcloud beta sql operations list` still
    does).

*   Fixed issue with `gcloud sql instances clone` when `--bin-log-file-name` and
    `--bin-log-position` are set.
    (<https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35906280>).

## 0.9.81 (2015-10-07)

### Breaking Changes

*   If you are using a service account to run commands under
    `gcloud preview app`, you must enable the "App Engine Admin API" in the
    Developers Console (<https://console.developers.google.com>; navigate to
    **APIs and Auth > APIs**).

*   In a future Cloud SDK release, deployments that promote the new version to
    receive all traffic will stop the previous version by default.

    To keep the current behavior, pass the `--no-stop-previous-version`
    flag, or run the following command:

       $ gcloud config set app/stop_previous_version false

*   Removed `app get-resource-limits` command.

### App Engine

*   App Engine components updated to 1.9.27. Please see the following release
    notes for details:
    *   Python: <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/release-notes>
    *   Java: <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/release-notes>
*   The `gcloud preview app deploy` command now requires that users specify or
    omit the runtime: field from app.yaml if a Dockerfile is also specified.
*   The `gcloud preview app deploy` command now supports the "engines" field in
    package.json for node.js applications.

### Misc. Changes

*   Windows Installer has an option to run `gcloud init` after the installation
  finishes.

## 0.9.80 (2015-09-30)

*   `gcloud app`
    *   Soon, deployments will set the deployed version to receive all traffic
        by default.  To keep the current behavior, use the `--no-promote` flag
        or run the following command:

            $ gcloud config set app/promote_by_default false

        To adopt the new behavior early, use the `--promote` flag or run the
        following command:

            $ gcloud config set app/promote_by_default true

    *   The `--set-default` flag is deprecated. Please use the `--promote` flag
        instead.
    *   In a future Cloud SDK release, deployments that promote the new version
        to receive all traffic will stop the previous version by default.  To
        keep the current behavior, pass the `--no-stop-previous-version` flag,
        or run the following command:

            $ gcloud config set app/stop_previous_version true

    *   The `app run` command is deprecated and will soon be removed.  Please
        use dev_appserver (found in the same directory as the `gcloud command)
        instead.
    *   The `gcloud preview app modules download command` is deprecated, and
        will be removed soon.

*   The Windows installer has an option to run `gcloud init` after the
    installation finishes.
*   The `preview` component has been removed.
    *   The `gcloud preview app` commands remain available as usual and
        are still shipped through the `app` component.
    *   Please use `gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged` instead
        of `gcloud preview instance-groups`.  Note that you will need to
        modify some command invocations when switching to the non-preview
        commands.
    *   Please use `gcloud compute instance-groups managed` instead of
        `gcloud preview managed-instance-groups`.  Note that you will need to
        modify some command invocations when switching to the non-preview
        commands.
*   All Google Compute User Accounts commands have moved to beta.
*   Deployment-manager list commands now support pagination.
*   Minor bug fixes.

## 0.9.79 (2015-09-23)

*   The following commands have been promoted from beta to GA:
    *   gcloud config configurations ...
    *   gcloud source repos clone
    *   gcloud beta init. Old `gcloud init` behavior has been removed, and
        partially replaced by new gcloud init or directly via gcloud source
        repos clone.
*   Release gcloud beta dataproc.
*   The --env-vars flag in gcloud preview app deploy has been removed.
*   Automatic ssh key generation respects the --quiet flag.
*   The --format flag now supports extended format expressions. For details run
    $ gcloud topic formats.
*   Most commands now document the positive Boolean --FLAG form and accept
    --no-FLAG to disable. For the past few releases --log-http accepted an
    optional true/false value. It has been restored to its original definition
    of being a Boolean flag that has no value.
*   `gcloud sql` operations are now automatically retried for 2s in case of
    HttpException: The Cloud SQL instance operation does not exist.
*   Update gcloud's kubectl from 1.0.5 to 1.0.6.
*   Deprecate `gcloud preview app get-resource-limits`.

## 0.9.78 (2015-09-16)

*   App Engine components updated to 1.9.26. Please visit
    <https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/wiki/SdkReleaseNotes> for
    details.
*   Increase the default boot disk size for remote build VMs in
    `gcloud preview app deploy`.
*   The `--instance` flag to the `gcloud preview app modules set-managed-by`
    command now takes an instance name instead of an index.
*   The V1Beta4 API for sqladmin can now be accessed through the
    `gcloud beta sql` surface.
*   Usability enhancements for `gcloud beta init` and named configurations.

## 0.9.77 (2015-09-09)

*   gcloud preview logging is now gcloud beta logging.
*   Update kubectl to version 1.0.5
*   Windows Cloud SDK installer improvements:
    *   Now allows changing the installation mode. You can choose between a
        "current user" installation and an "all users" installation.
    *   Now has an uninstaller and writes "Add/Remove Programs" uninstall
        entries.
*   Removal of unsupported --env-vars argument from gcloud preview app deploy.
*   gcloud compute instance groups: Allow --named-ports flag to be empty and
    clean named ports in set-named-ports commands.
*   Change in gcloud compute backend-services: introduce new flag
    --instance-group which takes advantage of new Instance Groups API.

## 0.9.76 (2015-09-02)

*   Update gsutil component to 4.14.
*   Resource views commands have moved from preview to alpha. Please use `gcloud
    alpha compute resource-views` in place of `gcloud preview resource-views`.
*   Replica pool commands have moved from preview to alpha. Please use `gcloud
    alpha compute replica-pools` in place of `gcloud preview replica-pools`.
*   `gcloud beta source repo` was renamed to `gcloud beta source repos`
*   Created google-cloud-sdk-announce@googlegroups.com
    <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/google-cloud-sdk-announce> email group to
    announce new releases and other important information.
*   'gcloud alpha init' command is now also in beta.
*   Add target size of managed instance group for "compute instance-groups
    managed list" command.
*   Fixed the removal of platform-specific components when running `gcloud
    components remove`.
*   Fixed a bug related to checking for SDK updates when the SDK is installed as
    root (like on Debian Compute Engine images).
    *   Affected users should now see less frequent update messages and overall
        improved gcloud performance
*   `gcloud preview app deploy` won't update local images automatically anymore.

## 0.9.75 (2015-08-26)

*   Container Engine
    *   Container Engine GA commands available under `gcloud container`.
    *   `gcloud beta container get-credentials` now takes cluster name as
        argument instead of `--cluster` flag for consistency with other
        commands.
    *   Added `gcloud alpha container clusters update <cluster>
        --cloud-monitoring=<val>` command.
*   New release notes are printed on upgrade. (This won't take effect until
    an upgrade from this version to a later version.)
*   New `gcloud alpha genomics variantsets export` command.
*   Commands promoted from `gcloud alpha` to `gcloud beta`:
    *    `gcloud beta config configurations ...`
    *    `gcloud beta sources clone`
*   Improvements in error reporting and default output formatting.


## 0.9.74 (2015-08-19)

*   New list and import commands under `gcloud alpha genomics variants`.
*   Removed `--remote` flag. Instead, please use the `--docker-build=remote`
    flag (or use `--docker-build=local` to force a local build).
*   In this release, Docker builds are hosted by default. To opt-in to the old
    behavior, please use the `--docker-build=local` flag.


## 0.9.73 (2015-08-12)

*   gcloud sql instances create default to MySQL 5.6
*   gcloud beta container get-credentials renamed to gcloud beta container
    clusters get-credentials
*   New commands
    *   gcloud beta projects ...
    *   gcloud alpha genomics callsets ...
    *   gcloud beta emulators datastore ...
    *   gcloud beta container get-server-config
    *   gcloud alpha config configurations


## 0.9.72 (2015-08-05)

*   gcloud compute
    *   initial surface changes for the backend-bucket.
    *   `instance-groups set-named-ports`: introduced a new flag
        `--named-ports NAME:PORT,[NAME:PORT,...]` - no need to specify names
        and ports in separate flags.
*   gcloud preview app deploy
    Deprecate `--remote` flag in preparation for hosted Docker builds by
    default. Instead, please use the `--docker-build={remote,local}` flag.
    The default is still a local Docker build; in two releases, the default
    will switch to a hosted build.
*   New gcloud alpha genomics operations {list, cancel, describe} commands


## 0.9.71 (2015-07-29)

*   Launching `gcloud alpha pubsub` commands.
*   Moved `gcloud preview rolling-updates` to `gcloud alpha compute
    rolling-updates`.

    disks.
*   Beta launch of customer supplied encryption keys for Compute Engine.
*   Updated kubectl to 1.0.1.
*   `gcloud alpha container` commands now target Container Engine v1 API.
    Options for `gcloud alpha container clusters create` updated accordingly:
    *   `--user` renamed to `--username`
    *   `--cluster-api-version` removed. Cluster version is not selectable in v1
        API; new clusters always created at latest supported version.
    *   `--image` option removed. Source image not selectable in v1 API;
        clusters are always created with latest supported ContainerVM image.
        Note that using an unsupported image (i.e. not ContainerVM) would
        result in an unusable cluster in most cases anyway.
    *   Added `--no-enable-cloud-monitoring` to turn off cloud monitoring
        (on by default).
    *   Added `--disk-size` option for specifying boot disk size of node vms.
*   App Engine components updated to 1.9.24. Please visit
    <https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/wiki/SdkReleaseNotes> for
    details.

    For several months on the Managed VMs team we've been testing a new mode of
    `dockerless` local development on gcloud that makes developing a module for
    Python, Java and Go users similar to development of regular App Engine
    applications. This new mode relaxes the sandbox constraints present in the
    devappserver for `vm: false` applications, and does not require Docker to be
    installed.

    You can currently opt-into this behavior by setting GAE_LOCAL_VM_RUNTIME=1;
    In this release of the Cloud SDK, we will be making this behavior the
    default for Managed VM users who are using gcloud.

    You can still opt-out of this behavior by setting: GAE_LOCAL_VM_RUNTIME=0.

    For custom runtime users, if you are relying on the local Development Server
    to build your application, will now need to pass the `--custom-entrypoint`
    flag to `gcloud preview app run` to provide gcloud with the correct
    command to call.

    This does not affect users developing for non-managed VMs, or for users who
    are not using gcloud."
*   Bug fixes for:
    *   `gcloud preview app deploy` file paths issue on Windows.
    *   `gcloud compute instance-groups managed wait-until-stable` periodic user
        prompting for target zone.


## 0.9.70 (2015-07-22)

*   Add `gcloud compute instance-groups` commands.
*   Move `gcloud beta deployment-manager` commands to general availability as
    `gcloud deployment-manager` and update to use the v2beta3 API. This change
    does not alter the gcloud surface for users of the deployment-manager
    component.
*   Update kubectl to 1.0.0.
*   `gcloud alpha genomics` commands now use the genomics V1 API. The
    --project-number flag for `dataset create` and `dataset list` is now
    obsolete. The configured --project-id is used instead and can be overridden
    with the --project-id flag.
*   Fix hang on errors in `gcloud preview app deploy`.

## 0.9.69 (2015-07-15)

*   Update kubectl to 0.20.2.
*   Fix an authentication issue with 'gcloud docker' affecting docker version
    1.7.0 and later.
*   Remove `gcloud preview dm-v2` command group.
*   Remove `gcloud preview deployment-manager` command group
    (`gcloud beta deployment-manager` still exists; see
    <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/#install-version> if you want to pin your
    installation to an old version).
*   Bug fixes.

## 0.9.68 (2015-07-08)

*   Deprecated gcutil tool is no longer distributed with Cloud SDK.
    It is still available via <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcutil>.
*   Added support for Container engine BETA commands under the
    `gcloud beta container` command group.  Existing `gcloud alpha container`
    commands are unchanged.

    SDK.
    *    App Engine functionality can still be used through the
        `gcloud preview app` command group.
    *    The gae-java, gae-python, gae-php, and gae-go components no longer
         exist in the component manager.
    *    If you need to use appcfg or dev_appserver directly, these are still
         available in the App Engine SDK downloads that can be found here:
         <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads>
*   Bug fixes.

## 0.9.67 (2015-07-01)

*   App Engine components updated to 1.9.23. Please visit
    <https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/wiki/SdkReleaseNotes> for

    which are not managed by Instance Group Manager
*   Moved `gcloud beta sql instances connect` to `gcloud beta sql connect`.
*   Smarter polling while waiting for SQL operations to finish, reducing the
    number of requests sent to the server.
*   Linux/Mac install script disables prompts if there is no controlling tty.
*   Linux/Mac install script now properly detects zsh and ksh RC files.

    *   Existing gcloud commands will be replicated under this new group, but
        use the beta version of their API instead of the GA version.
    *   New command behavior and features that are beta only will first appear
        under this group until the feature gets promoted to general

## 0.9.49 (2015-02-25)

*   The Google Container Registry is now used by default for deployment of
    Managed VM applications. See here for more information:
    <https://cloud.google.com/tools/container-registry/>
*   We've increased the speed of the "image push" phase of Managed VM
    deployments.
*   The heavy lifting of retrieving the Go toolchain has been moved into the
    base Go Docker image which dramatically reduces the bandwidth consumed
    locally when running and deploying your images. You must delete your
    Dockerfile to pick up the changes.
*   We've fixed several bugs related to port forwarding in the local
    devappserver.

## 0.9.48 (2015-02-18)
