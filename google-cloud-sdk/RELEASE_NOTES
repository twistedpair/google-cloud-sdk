  _FORMAT-STRING_ can be any format (json, table, ...).
  Try: `gcloud compute instances list
  --format="table[box](name, disks:format='table[no-heading](deviceName:sort=1,
  kind)')"`

* Added list field aggregation formatting (similar to nested formatting) by
  `--format="table(listField2:format=FORMAT-STRING)"`. When the main table
  has no columns each nested format is aggregated into a single list.
  Try: `gcloud compute instances list
  --format="table(disks:format='table[box](deviceName:sort=1, kind)')"`

## 94.0.0 (2016/1/27)

### Google Compute Engine

* Added `gcloud alpha compute url-maps list-cache-invalidations` command.

  and `remove-iam-policy-binding` for the `gcloud beta projects` surface.

* Added the `gcloud projects list` command that can be used to list projects.

## 93.0.0 (2016/1/20)

* kubectrl upgraded to 1.1.4.

* `gcloud beta dataproc cluster create` now supports `--properties` flag to set
  properties for installed packages.

  git command.

## 92.0.0 (2016/1/13)

*   Because of the rollback of 91.0.0, this release contains all of the changes
    from 91.0.0 in addition to the changes listed below.

### Breaking Changes

*   `gcloud preview app deploy`

    *   Changed deployments to set the deployed versions to receive all traffic
        for their modules by default.

        To keep the old behavior (traffic split remains the same), use the
        `--no-promote` flag or run
        `gcloud config set app/promote_by_default true`.

        Note that your old versions are still running, and must be stopped
        manually. This behavior will change in a future release.

    *   Removed deprecated `--set-default` flag.  Please use `--promote`
        instead.

    *   `gcloud preview app deploy`: Removed deprecated `--env-vars` flag.

*   The output of the `gcloud preview app modules list` command has been
    changed to include the traffic split percentage instead of the 'default
    version' field.

*   Removed deprecated `gcloud preview app modules cancel-deployment` command.

    This command is no longer necessary due to recent improvements in the
    Deployment API.

*   Removed deprecated `gcloud preview app modules download` command.

    This command is no longer necessary due to recent improvements in the
    Deployment API.

*   Removed deprecated `gcloud preview app run` command. Please use
    `dev_appserver.py` instead.

*   Changed behavior of the `--zone`/`-z` flag in the `gcloud dns record-sets`
    command group. This flag can no longer precede the command. For instance,
    `gcloud dns record-sets -z=mz list` will not work, but
    `gcloud dns record-sets list -z=mz` will.

*   Changed `--password-file` option for `sql instances set-root-password`;
    password now does not include trailing newline from password file. This
    matches the documented behavior, but not the previous behavior.
    (Fixes https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=419)

*   Removed `meta/active_configuration` from the results of `gcloud config list`
    since it is not a property that can be set. You can continue to use the
    `gcloud config configurations` commands to view and manage your
    configurations.

### Cloud SDK

*   Added `gcloud config` proxy settings. Users can configure `gcloud` to use a
    proxy via the following settings:

    *   `gcloud config proxy/address`

    *   `gcloud config proxy/password`

    *   `gcloud config proxy/port`

    *   `gcloud config proxy/type`

    *   `gcloud config proxy/username`

*   Added `alpha` and `beta` components to Debian packages.

*   Removed unused config properties: `app/hosted_registry`, `app/host`,
   `app/admin_host`, `app/api_host`.

### Google Cloud Logging

*   Migrated to
    [v2beta1](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/introduction_v2) API
    release.

    *   Moved `gcloud beta logging sinks` commands to `v2beta1`.

    *   Added `gcloud beta logging resource-descriptors` command to display
        supported resources from various services.

    *   Added `gcloud beta logging read` command to retrieve log entries using
        filters.

### Google Container Engine

*   Added `gcloud container clusters resize` for resizing Container Engine
    clusters.

*   Added notifications when node upgrades are available to `gcloud container
    cluster describe` and `list` commands.

### Google App Engine

*   Fixed bug where initial deployments using `--image-url` failed.

*   Changed `gcloud preview app modules set_default` command to use the App
    Engine Admin API.

*   Changed `gcloud preview app modules list` command to use the App Engine
    Admin API.


## 91.0.1 (2015/12/16)

* The Cloud SDK has been rolled back to 90.0.0.

## 91.0.0 (2015/12/16)

### Breaking Changes

* Deprecated command group `gcloud compute replica-pools` has been removed.
* Deprecated command group `gcloud compute resource-views` has been removed.
* App Engine API is now the only supported method for deploying in the
  `gcloud preview app deploy` command.

### Google App Engine

* `DEPLOYABLES` argument for `gcloud preview app deploy` is now optional. If not
   given, the command defaults to `app.yaml` in the current directory; if that
   is not found, it attempts to automatically generate necessary configuration
   files (such as app.yaml) in the current directory before deployment.
*  `--force` argument to `gcloud preview app deploy` is now deprecated and will
   be removed in a future release.

### Container

* `gcloud container` commands that poll long running operations (e.g create,
   delete, upgrade) now display progress details when available.


## 90.0.0 (2015/12/09)

* Cloud SDK release version scheme has changed. Patch version is now treated as
  a major release version which corresponds to SDK weekly releases.
  Any updates/fixes to released version will increment minor/patch version
  number going forward.

### Breaking Changes

* The deprecated flag --clear-target-pool has been removed from
  `gcloud compute instance-groups managed set-target-pools` command.

### Google App Engine

* Components updated to 1.9.30.
  Please visit the following release notes for details:
  * Python - https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/release-notes
  * Java - https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/release-notes
* Fixed a bug caused by uploading invalid file names for vm: true applications.

### Compute

* Subnetwork support has been promoted from alpha to beta. For more information
  see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/subnetworks.


## 0.9.89 (2015/12/02)

### Breaking Changes

*   Removed flag `--container-ipv4-cidr` for `gcloud container clusters create`;
    please use `--cluster-ipv4-cidr` instead.

*   Renamed `gcloud alpha compute vpn-tunnels create --ike-networks` to
    `--local-traffic-selector`.

*   `gcloud alpha compute resource-views` commands will soon be removed. Please
    use `gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged` commands instead.

*   `gcloud alpha compute replica-pools` commands will soon be removed. Please
    use `gcloud compute instance-groups` commands instead.

### `gcloud` Core

*   Changed behavior of `gcloud init` git repository clone option. It now takes
    as input a path to the destination directory for the repository,
    rather than the parent directory of the repository destination.

### BigQuery

*   Fixed failure in `gcloud alpha biquery query "select * from ..."` command
    while displaying query results.

### Compute

*   Fixed `gcloud alpha compute instances set-machine-type` failure when
    supplying custom cpu/custom memory, but no zone.

*   Added a new scope alias for Cloud Monitoring: `monitoring-write`. This scope
    is on by default in all new VMs.

### Google Cloud DNS

*   Added `--replace-origin-ns` flag to `gcloud dns record-sets import` command
    to allow importing NS records.

### Google Cloud Storage

*   Updated `gsutil` component to 4.16.

### Google Container Engine

*   Updated kubectl to version 1.1.2.

*   Increased `gcloud container clusters create/delete` timeouts from 20m to
    30m.

*   Added `--subnetwork` flag to `gcloud container clusters create` to allow
    creation of container clusters can now be created in a Google Compute Engine
    subnetwork (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/subnetworks).


## 0.9.88 (2015/11/25)

### Breaking Changes

* The `gcloud preview app run` command has now been removed. Please use the
  bundled `dev_appserver.py` script directly instead.

* App Engine: The 'version' and 'application' fields in module and configuration
  files are now illegal. Project name should instead be specified either by
  `gcloud config set project MY_PROJECT` or by setting the `--project` flag on
  individual command executions. Versions are generated automatically by default
  but can also be manually specified by setting the `--version` flag on
  individual command executions.

### App Engine

* Don't do runtime identification for custom runtimes during deploy. This fixes
  issue [#387](https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=387).

* The `dev_appserver.py` script no longer requires the installation of all App
  Engine components. It will install only the necessary ones at run time.
  Fixes [#273](https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=273)

### Core

* Added the `gcloud components install` command.  This allows you to install
  missing components at the version of the SDK you currently have (it does not
  update your SDK installation).  `gcloud components update` should now only be
  used to update your SDK to the latest version.

* Fixes [#293](https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=293)
  related SSL certificate validation issues.

* Use zsh builtins in path.zsh.inc for faster/cleaner shell startup.

## 0.9.87 (2015/11/18)

### Compute

* `gcloud alpha compute instances create` now supports --custom-cpu and
   --custom-memory flags to specify custom machine types.

### Dataproc

* Added `gcloud beta dataproc clusters diagnose` command. See
  <https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/support/diagnose-command> for more info.

### Google Container Engine

* Updated kubectl to version 1.1.1.

## 0.9.86 (2015/11/11)

### App Engine

* Generated node.js Dockerfiles now add the full application context before
  running install hooks.

* For Google App Engine Node.js runtimes, install requested version of node
  prior to doing an npm install.

### Compute

* `gcloud beta compute instances set-machine-type` has been promoted from alpha
  to beta,

## 0.9.85 (2015/11/04)

### Breaking Changes

* `gcloud alpha compute networks create` now requires --mode flag.

### App Engine

* Added the --output-directory option to gen-repo-info-file command. This option
  supersedes --output-file, which is deprecated and will be removed in a future
  release.

* Improved error message when specified yaml file is not found.

### Compute

* Launching `gcloud alpha compute networks subnets`.

* `gcloud compute alpha instance-templates` and `instances` now support
  subnetworks.

* New flag --ike-networks in `gcloud alpha compute vpn-tunnels create`.

* `gcloud compute ssh` now passes through the exit code of the ssh command. This
  fixes issue
  [#146 ](https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=146).

### Misc. Changes

* Gracefully handle socket timeouts while checking for Google Compute Engine
  metadata server. This fixes issue
  [#339](https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=339).

## 0.9.84 (2015/10/28)

### App Engine

* Due to PageSpeed service deprecation, user will receive a warning when
  deploying a new version to App Engine.

* Implemented fingerprinting support for Java.

* The gen-config flag now generates only app.yaml for the matching runtime by
  default, you must use the --custom flag to generate an app.yaml with a runtime
  of "custom" and Dockerfile (and other configs).

### Compute

* GA support for HTTPS load balancing features.

* Deprecated --clear-target-pool flag from compute instance-groups managed
  set-target-pools command.

### Windows support

* Windows Installer can now take a /logtofile flag to write installation logs to
  file CloudSDKInstall.log located in the same directory.

* Windows installer now displays an error message when the installation
  does not succeed.

### Command Line Interface support

* The [page=N] table format attribute prints one or more tables of at most N
  rows. Use this to view paged server data as it arrives at the client.

## 0.9.83 (2015/10/21)

### App Engine

* In a future release, the `gcloud preview app deploy` command will no longer
  support deploying multiple modules in the same invocation.

### Compute

* Ubuntu 14.10 is end of life: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases

* Fixed external issue
  [#291](https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=291),
  related to handling network addresses on Windows.

### Container Engine

* `gcloud container clusters list` now displays the current number of nodes
  for the cluster.

### Windows support

* When running Cloud SDK tools from PowerShell the `gcloud-ps.ps1` wrapper
  scripts now can be used which no longer call to `cmd.exe`. Using `gcloud-ps`,
  complex arguments can be passed without escaping for Windows command line.
  Using `gcloud`, the following command would be correctly escaped when running
  gcloud in PowerShell:

    gcloud fun --arg='"test ^< 123"'

  With the new `gcloud-ps`, the same command can be simply written as:

    gcloud-ps fun --arg='test < 123'

  Permissions to run PowerShell scripts must be given to PowerShell before these
  will work. Permissions can be changed with
  `"Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned"`.

## 0.9.82 (2015/10/14)

### App Engine

*   The App Engine Admin API is now the default path for deployments in the
    `gcloud preview app deploy` command. This transition should be transparent,
    but if you experience any issues and would like to revert to the old
    behavior, please run `gcloud config set app/use_appengine_api false`.

    See <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/> for more
    information about this API.

*   With `env: 2`, valid python runtimes are `python` and `python-compat`.

*   Implemented fingerprinting support for python.

### Container Engine

*   `gcloud container clusters create`: The flag `--container-ipv4-cidr` has
    been deprecated; `--cluster-ipv4-cidr` should be used instead.

### SQL

*   `gcloud beta sql operations describe` and `gcloud beta sql operations wait`
    no longer need `--instance` flag (`gcloud beta sql operations list` still
    does).

*   Fixed issue with `gcloud sql instances clone` when `--bin-log-file-name` and
    `--bin-log-position` are set.
    (<https://code.google.com/p/google-cloud-sdk/issues/detail?id=201>).

## 0.9.81 (2015/10/07)

### Breaking Changes

*   If you are using a service account to run commands under
    `gcloud preview app`, you must enable the "App Engine Admin API" in the
    Developers Console (<https://console.developers.google.com>; navigate to
    **APIs and Auth > APIs**).

*   In a future Cloud SDK release, deployments that promote the new version to
    receive all traffic will stop the previous version by default.

    To keep the current behavior, pass the `--no-stop-previous-version`
    flag, or run the following command:

       $ gcloud config set app/stop_previous_version false

*   Removed `app get-resource-limits` command.

### App Engine

*   App Engine components updated to 1.9.27. Please see the following release
    notes for details:
    *   Python: <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/release-notes>
    *   Java: <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/release-notes>
*   The `gcloud preview app deploy` command now requires that users specify or
    omit the runtime: field from app.yaml if a Dockerfile is also specified.
*   The `gcloud preview app deploy` command now supports the "engines" field in
    package.json for node.js applications.

### Misc. Changes

*   Windows Installer has an option to run `gcloud init` after the installation
  finishes.

## 0.9.80 (2015/09/30)

*   `gcloud app`
    *   Soon, deployments will set the deployed version to receive all traffic
        by default.  To keep the current behavior, use the `--no-promote` flag
        or run the following command:

            $ gcloud config set app/promote_by_default false

        To adopt the new behavior early, use the `--promote` flag or run the
        following command:

            $ gcloud config set app/promote_by_default true

    *   The `--set-default` flag is deprecated. Please use the `--promote` flag
        instead.
    *   In a future Cloud SDK release, deployments that promote the new version
        to receive all traffic will stop the previous version by default.  To
        keep the current behavior, pass the `--no-stop-previous-version` flag,
        or run the following command:

            $ gcloud config set app/stop_previous_version true

    *   The `app run` command is deprecated and will soon be removed.  Please
        use dev_appserver (found in the same directory as the `gcloud command)
        instead.
    *   The `gcloud preview app modules download command` is deprecated, and
        will be removed soon.

*   The Windows installer has an option to run `gcloud init` after the
    installation finishes.
*   The `preview` component has been removed.
    *   The `gcloud preview app` commands remain available as usual and
        are still shipped through the `app` component.
    *   Please use `gcloud compute instance-groups unmanaged` instead
        of `gcloud preview instance-groups`.  Note that you will need to
        modify some command invocations when switching to the non-preview
        commands.
    *   Please use `gcloud compute instance-groups managed` instead of
        `gcloud preview managed-instance-groups`.  Note that you will need to
        modify some command invocations when switching to the non-preview
        commands.
*   All Google Compute User Accounts commands have moved to beta.
*   Deployment-manager list commands now support pagination.
*   Minor bug fixes.

## 0.9.79 (2015/09/23)

*   The following commands have been promoted from beta to GA:
    *   gcloud config configurations ...
    *   gcloud source repos clone
    *   gcloud beta init. Old `gcloud init` behavior has been removed, and
        partially replaced by new gcloud init or directly via gcloud source
        repos clone.
*   Release gcloud beta dataproc.
*   The --env-vars flag in gcloud preview app deploy has been removed.
*   Automatic ssh key generation respects the --quiet flag.
*   The --format flag now supports extended format expressions. For details run
    $ gcloud topic formats.
*   Most commands now document the positive Boolean --FLAG form and accept
    --no-FLAG to disable. For the past few releases --log-http accepted an
    optional true/false value. It has been restored to its original definition
    of being a Boolean flag that has no value.
*   `gcloud sql` operations are now automatically retried for 2s in case of
    HttpException: The Cloud SQL instance operation does not exist.
*   Update gcloud's kubectl from 1.0.5 to 1.0.6.
*   Deprecate `gcloud preview app get-resource-limits`.

## 0.9.75 (2015/08/26)

*   Container Engine
    *   Container Engine GA commands available under `gcloud container`.
    *   `gcloud beta container get-credentials` now takes cluster name as
        argument instead of `--cluster` flag for consistency with other
        commands.
    *   Added `gcloud alpha container clusters update <cluster>
        --cloud-monitoring=<val>` command.
*   New release notes are printed on upgrade. (This won't take effect until
    an upgrade from this version to a later version.)

*   Removed `--remote` flag. Instead, please use the `--docker-build=remote`
    flag (or use `--docker-build=local` to force a local build).
*   In this release, Docker builds are hosted by default. To opt-in to the old
    behavior, please use the `--docker-build=local` flag.


## 0.9.73 (2015/08/12)

*   gcloud sql instances create default to MySQL 5.6
*   gcloud beta container get-credentials renamed to gcloud beta container
    clusters get-credentials

*   gcloud compute
    *   initial surface changes for the backend-bucket.
    *   `instance-groups set-named-ports`: introduced a new flag
        `--named-ports NAME:PORT,[NAME:PORT,...]` - no need to specify names
        and ports in separate flags.
*   gcloud preview app deploy
    Deprecate `--remote` flag in preparation for hosted Docker builds by
    default. Instead, please use the `--docker-build={remote,local}` flag.

    Options for `gcloud alpha container clusters create` updated accordingly:
    *   `--user` renamed to `--username`
    *   `--cluster-api-version` removed. Cluster version is not selectable in v1
        API; new clusters always created at latest supported version.
    *   `--image` option removed. Source image not selectable in v1 API;
        clusters are always created with latest supported ContainerVM image.
        Note that using an unsupported image (i.e. not ContainerVM) would
        result in an unusable cluster in most cases anyway.
    *   Added `--no-enable-cloud-monitoring` to turn off cloud monitoring
        (on by default).
    *   Added `--disk-size` option for specifying boot disk size of node vms.

    <https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/wiki/SdkReleaseNotes> for
    details.

    For several months on the Managed VMs team we've been testing a new mode of
    `dockerless` local development on gcloud that makes developing a module for
    Python, Java and Go users similar to development of regular App Engine
    applications. This new mode relaxes the sandbox constraints present in the
    devappserver for `vm: false` applications, and does not require Docker to be
    installed.

    You can currently opt-into this behavior by setting GAE_LOCAL_VM_RUNTIME=1;
    In this release of the Cloud SDK, we will be making this behavior the
    default for Managed VM users who are using gcloud.

    You can still opt-out of this behavior by setting: GAE_LOCAL_VM_RUNTIME=0.

    For custom runtime users, if you are relying on the local Development Server
    to build your application, will now need to pass the `--custom-entrypoint`
    flag to `gcloud preview app run` to provide gcloud with the correct
    command to call.

    This does not affect users developing for non-managed VMs, or for users who
    are not using gcloud."
*   Bug fixes for:
    *   `gcloud preview app deploy` file paths issue on Windows.
    *   `gcloud compute instance-groups managed wait-until-stable` periodic user

    `gcloud deployment-manager` and update to use the v2beta3 API. This change
    does not alter the gcloud surface for users of the deployment-manager
    component.
*   Update kubectl to 1.0.0.
*   `gcloud alpha genomics` commands now use the genomics V1 API. The
    --project-number flag for `dataset create` and `dataset list` is now
    obsolete. The configured --project-id is used instead and can be overridden
    with the --project-id flag.
*   Fix hang on errors in `gcloud preview app deploy`.
